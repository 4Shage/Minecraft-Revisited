Not only do items stay inside the interface after closing, also some annoying restrictions are removed. Also name tags can be renamed without even using an anvil.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">First of all, anvils now have an <strong>Inventory</strong> for storing the items you put inside. This also means items will stay in the anvil after you close the interface. To put this functionality to good use, anvil contents will now <strong>Render</strong> as laying on top of the anvil.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvils no longer use the prior work penalty tag, so no matter how often you repair an item or add new enchantments to it, <strong>Costs Won't Needlessly Increase</strong>. You can also fully <strong>Configure The Max Level Limit</strong>, which controls when the <i>Too Expensive!</i> flag shows up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvils can now be <strong>Repaired</strong> by one stage using iron blocks. You can also use a dispenser to automate repairing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Name tags have quite a few nice changes: Not only is setting a name in an anvil <strong>Completely Free</strong> and doesn't risk damaging your precious anvil, you don't even need an anvil at all anymore to change a name tag's name. Simply shift + right-click a name tag to <strong>Open A Simple Interface</strong> for setting a new name.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Text Can Be Stylized</strong> using Minecraft's native formatting codes in both the anvil and name tag interface. This allows for setting custom colors and styles when choosing item and entity names. Check the <a href=\"https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes#Usage\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Minecraft Wiki</strong></span></a> for more information on formatting codes.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/27/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/28/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Anvils can be so fancy!</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Free name tag renames</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/29/2022-09-29_09.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/30/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>No max level limit anymore</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>No anvil required for renaming name tags anymore</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/422/2022-10-04_21.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/424/2022-10-04_21.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Repair anvils by one stage using iron blocks</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Use formatting codes when naming your equipment</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I want enchanting tables to keep and render their contents as well!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Sure thing, check out my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/easy-magic\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Easy Magic</span></a> mod which does just that and more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I download this mod for Forge on versions of Minecraft before 1.17?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Check out the mods which inspired this project: <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/anvil-tweaks\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvil Tweaks</span></a>, <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/anvil-repair\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvil Repair</span></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nametags-without-anvils\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Nametags Without Anvils</span></a> by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/tfarecnim\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>tfarecnim</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Mods can have three different kinds of configs depending on the kind of settings they provide: <strong>Client</strong>, <strong>Common</strong>, and <strong>Server</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Client</strong> and <strong>Common</strong> configs are found in <code>/.minecraft/config/</code>, named as <code>&lt;modId&gt;-client.toml</code> and <code>&lt;modId&gt;-common.toml</code>, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Server</strong> configs though are applied per world, therefore you'll find those in <code>/.minecraft/saves/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for local singeplayer worlds, and in <code>/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for you Minecraft server. Changes made to a server config only apply to that one world. Setting default values in server configs for all <strong>newly</strong> created worlds is possible by copying the modified server config to <code>/.minecraft/defaultconfigs/</code>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In a local singleplayer world you can quickly find config files by running the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command and by choosing <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code> or <code>SERVER</code>. Then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to open the file in a text editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">On some mod loaders editing configs is also supported in-game via the <strong>Mods</strong> menu option. On some Minecraft versions you can also install my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for

API","description":"A flexible and expandable accessory/equipment API for users and developers.","body":"Curios is a flexible and expandable accessory/equipment API for users and developers. The purpose is to provide functionality for developers to add extra accessory/equipment slots in a convenient and compatible manner, as well as to give users the ability to configure these slots to their preferences. By default, Curios does not add any content except for an inventory GUI. There are no slots and only two items, the latter only being available through the Creative menu and primarily serving as examples for developers to use when coding their own integration.\n\n## Features\n* **Expandable equipment slots through a central library.** New equipment slots can be made and managed easily through an identifier registry. Identical identifiers will be merged together to avoid functional redundancies and provide maximum compatibility to potential items, while unique identifiers can still be used to mark special types when appropriate.\n* **Slots are only made on-demand.** There are no slots included by default, all slots are created only as needed. This reduces instances where one or more superfluous slots are present without any suitable items to go into the slot.\n* **Slots are completely customizable and manipulable.** Slots can have custom backgrounds, different sizes, and can even be disabled or hidden by default. But how would a player even access disabled slots? Through the API, developers can access functions to enable/disable a player's slots or add/remove a certain number of slots of a given type.\n* **Flexible item->curio relations using the vanilla tag system.** Potential curios are selected through the vanilla tag system, which means that categorizing items into curio types is as easy as creating a .json file in the data/curios/tags folder. Items can be categorized into as many curio types as you want as long as they're tagged in the appropriate files, and these settings can even be overridden entirely. For more information, see the vanilla tag system.\n* **Complete integration with other inventory mechanics.** Mending and Curses will work with all applicable items equipped in the curio slots. There are also various minor features for developers that make it simpler to integrate their current items or mechanics into the curio system.\n* **Accessible from a single GUI.** Curios comes with its own GUI accessible from the inventory that shows all of the available slots to a player. This allows players to see all of the extended equipment slots in a central location without needing to access different inventory GUIs. However, developers can still provide their own GUIs for their mod-specific slots if they want. The default keybinding for the GUI is 'g'.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/NNByxcQ/curiogui.png)\n\n## Documentation\n* [How to Use: Users](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/How-to-Use:-Users)\n* [How to Use: Developers](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/How-to-Use:-Developers)\n* [Commands](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/Commands)\n* [Frequently Used Slots](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/Frequently-Used-Slots)\n* [Adding to Your Project](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios#adding-to-your-project)","published":"2023-02-03T01:35:59.131618Z","updated":"2023-12-16T08:21:52.563585Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":182299,"followers":188,"categories":["equipment","library","utility"],"additional_categories":["adventure"],"game_versions":["1.13.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["ZOlETE5v","RcA3vNIJ","oxBwmsHU","BcHPbGLy","Hm7rMu2c","bE5ThdZW","kWbiHplj","L0vjJCcV","FgmAnDM9","tnz2VF5O","EOOHEkth","vMbFvqVI","T123DHPM","N0zclyEx","WhjxWZUb","9eeEgj08","FK7tyAY3","M9lGrwqm","5qPuCFYD","zkj9iD0D","46cAcdnU","tl7biScA","cpywqo8V","BenekUpa","jVW2AKPB","hTLLayrx","uvQEq1xO","hW3XKfcj","p4wqBrgO","h3K3CopK","SeLn387u","dlv1r8No","GbHsY4Wa","9yUPTnRR","q9hLiOWr","mZaeXk5V","CQtJcas9","Kw26k0tE","XdwwXlEI","HgHicKvP","l0t6GlWP","opCpnbhi","8zBiV8Xc","SdxNj4Fa","BKMikxx0","NI17MAnS","nEba8UUT","9fDBKv2o","wOH4YWOv","y3sKrQEo","RmUMdDtP","odCtDjUV","usPjZolF","VykFFfeC","69B5WqQH","H3lLmHqx","aKokCTY6","nSNsIPLm"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/vvuO3ImH/2a7323ca80849de0bcb50299e18acdf8bf394682.png"},"version":{"id":"dlv1r8No","project_id":"vvuO3ImH","author_id":"zbpHS3ry","featured":false,"name":"curios-forge-1.18.2-5.0.9.1","version_number":"1.18.2-5.0.9.1","changelog":"The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Forge Recommended Versioning](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/conventions/versioning/).\n\nThis is a copy of the changelog for the most recent version.

The structures themselves are a bit \nmore detailed than their vanilla counterparts, but they still fit seamlessly \ninto the world. Not only that but many are inspired by real-life buildings or \narchitectural styles, giving them a fresh new feel. There are over 50 structures \nadded by Towns and Towers so far (as of update 1.9), so have fun exploring! And \nremember, it’s not the destination that’s important, but the journey to get \nthere.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color=\"#FFE16A\">If you wish to see all \nof the structures our mod adds, take a look at our gallery </font>\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/CCZbqMn\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</h3>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><u>Compatibility</u></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a full list of mods \nthat are currently compatible with Towns and towers, please look\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gE5DvsPwztTtCVi_i6nEOLQM6tm8NU4Q1iCpuqHY2UM/edit\">\nhere</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pack should be \ncompatible with most world generation mods, like Terralith, WWOO, BYG, BoP, \netc., as well as mods that add also add new structures/villages, such as \nRepurposed Structures or ChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Villages. However, some \nfeatures from other mods are not currently present, like the guards from \nVillager Guards mod or certain buildings from Farmer's Delight for example. This \nwill be addressed in the future via a series of datapacks, which will implement \nfeatures from those mods into ours.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 align=\"center\"><strong><u>Frequently Asked Questions</u></strong></h2>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>1. Is it safe to update Towns and \nTowers to a newer version?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general yes. Just \nnote that sometimes when we update a few things get changed, so there might be a \nbit of console spam. If any serious problems arise because of that, let us know. \nAnd, as always, make backups. Better be safe than sorry.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>2. Is it safe to add \nTowns and Towers to an already existing world?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yep. Just note that the \nnew structures will only spawn in newly generated chunks.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>3. Is this mod for \nForge or Fabric/Quilt?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both. We have a \nuniversal version for both (now three?) mod loaders.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>4. How can I locate the new \nstructures?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 1.18.2: /locate \ntowns_and_towers:[structure_from_list]<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 1.19+: /locate structure \ntowns_and_towers:[structure_from_list]<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that some structures have the exclusives tag added \nin front. Those structures cannot be located if you only have T&amp;T installed. You \nalso need to have one of the mods that T&amp;T is paired with. For a full list, \nscroll down below (if I remember to add it...).<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>5. Does Towns and Towers modify \nexisting vanilla structures?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of the latest \nupdate, no. Only new structures are added.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>6. What about the \nloot of these structures?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority of \nstructures use vanilla loot tables for better mod compatibility (see the \nCompatibility section below for more info), but they also use some custom loot \ntables to better integrate said structures into the world. You will still find \npillager outpost loot in pillager outposts, profession chests in villages, as \nwell as bells, workstations, etc., but also new stuff like food, armor, and \nother goodies.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>7.

The whole tree will only break after a certain number of chops, and bigger trees require more chops. Inspired by mods like Treecapitator.\n\n#### Cool features:\n- Doesn't get too loud when breaking big trees\n- Works on mushrooms and fungi\n- Intelligently breaks leaves\n- Compatible with most modded trees\n\n#### Things to consider when lumberjacking:\n- Chopping trees doesn't require an axe, but will take a while without one\n- Chopping different blocks of the same tree will all contribute to bringing down the tree\n- Players can work together to chop down those big trees\n- Bigger trees require more total chops, but fewer chops per block*\n- Hold \"sneak\" when breaking a log block to break it normally\n\n_*By default, the number of chops required to fell a tree is computed logarithmically. Some example numbers are below. The number of chops can also be configured to scale linearly with the number of blocks to, for example, require one chop per block, or one chop per tree. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/hammertater/treechop#configuring-chop-counting-version-0130-and-later)._\n\n| Tree blocks |  Chops required |\n| ------------ | ---------------- |\n| 1  | 1 |\n| 3 | 3 |\n| 5 | 4 |\n| 10 | 7 |\n| 20 | 12 |\n| 50 | 19 |\n|100 | 25 |\n\n<details><summary>Compatibility:</summary>\n\n#### Special support for the following mods:\n- (1.18.2) [Tinker's Construct](https://modrinth.com/mod/tinkers-construct): broad axes perform extra chops. All axes perform more chops with \"expanded\" upgrades.\n- (1.18.2+) Silent Gear: saws perform extra chops\n- (1.18.2+) [Project MMO](https://modrinth.com/mod/project-mmo): chopping grants woodcutting XP\n- (1.18.2+) [Jade](https://modrinth.com/mod/jade), [WTHIT](https://modrinth.com/mod/wthit), [TheOneProbe](https://modrinth.com/mod/the-one-probe): show number of log blocks in trees and the number of chops needed to fell.\n\n#### Known issues:\n- (1.18.2 and earlier) Multi Mine: choppable blocks need to be added to Multi Mine's blacklist. This should be fixed for 1.19+ versions. See [#106](https://github.com/hammertater/treechop/issues/106).\n- Some modded trees leave floating blocks when felled. See [#44](https://github.com/hammertater/treechop/issues/44).\n\n_Want to make your mod compatible with TreeChop? See the [wiki](https://github.com/hammertater/treechop/wiki/Adding-compatibility-with-TreeChop)._\n\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>FAQ:</summary>\n\n#### 1. How do I turn off chopping?\nPress n to open TreeChop's in-game settings, then toggle off the \"chopping\" setting. A key can also be bound to toggle chopping without opening the settings screen; go to Options > Controls and find the section labeled \"HT's TreeChop\".\n\n#### 2. How do I keep chopping off and only turn it on while sneaking?\nBy default, sneaking inverts your current chop setting, so just toggle chopping off (press n to access the settings screen) so that chopping will be enabled by sneaking.\n\n#### 3. How do I keep chopping even when sneaking?\nPress n to open TreeChop's in-game settings, then toggle off the \"Sneaking inverts chopping\" setting.\n\n#### 4. How do I keep from chopping my house down?\nThere's a setting to disable chopping if the \"tree\" is not connected to leaves. Press n to open TreeChop's in-game settings, then toggle \"trees must have leaves\".\n\n#### 5. I started chopping my house down. How do I stop?\nIf you find yourself chopping a block when you just wanted to break it normally, try breaking the block while sneaking, or toggle off chopping (press n to access the settings screen).\n\n#### 6. I was chopping something and the game crashed! What's up with that?\nProbably the item you used to chop the tree doesn't play nice with TreeChop. Go to [your minecraft folder]/config/treechop-common.toml and add the item's registry name to choppingToolsBlacklist, or ask the server owner to, and then maybe let me know about the conflict and I'll try to fix it.\n\n#### 7. Why can't I chop anymore?\nMaybe chopping is turned off; press n to open TreeChop's in-game settings, then toggle on the \"chopping\" setting. If chopping is enabled and changing tools doesn't help, then there might be a conflict with another mod. If you send me a recent log, I'll try to fix it.\n\n#### 8. Why do some trees leave behind floating leaves when felled?\nEither\na) it's a modded tree and its leaves are not set up properly. Let me know what type of tree is misbehaving, and I'll politely inform the mod owners.\nb) there are too many leaves! You can increase the max number of leaves by going to [your minecraft folder]/config/treechop-common.toml and increasing maxLeavesBlocks.\n\n#### 9. Why do some trees leave behind floating logs when felled?\nEither\na) it's a modded tree and is weirdly shaped. Let me know, and I'll try to make TreeChop do a better job of detecting that type of tree.\nb) the tree is too big! You can increase the max tree size by going to [your minecraft folder]/config/treechop-common.toml and increasing maxTreeBlocks.\n\n#### 10. How do I disable mushroom and fungus chopping?\nGo to [your minecraft folder]/config/treechop-common.toml and change\n    blockTagForDetectingLogs = \"treechop:choppables\"\nto\n    blockTagForDetectingLogs = \"treechop:choppables_except_mushrooms\"\nIf you want more control over which blocks can be chopped, you have to make your own datapack and fiddle with the block tags (see https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tag for more info).\n\n#### 12. Why am I not seeing the [fill in the blank] feature?\nOnly the newest version of Minecraft 1.16 is fully supported. Some older versions, especially 1.12.2, lack some of the fancier features.\n\n#### 11. Can I include this in a modpack?\nYes!\n\n</details>\n\n\n<details><summary>Changelog:</summary>\n\n#### 0.17.8\n- (Forge) Fix chop indicator performance issue\n\n#### 0.17.7\n- Fix some API

Measurements made in an existing world at a render distance of 18.*\n\n### Canary for Minecraft Forge\n\n![Github License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/AbdElAziz333/Canary)\n![Github Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/AbdElAziz333/Canary)\n![Github Versions](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/AbdElAziz333/Canary)\n[![Architectury Forge Loom](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20With-Architectury%20Forge%20Loom-aqua)](https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom)\n[![This is a Fork](https://img.shields.io/badge/This%20is%20port-Support%20the%20original!-darkmagenta)](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium)\n\nCanary is a general-purpose optimization mod and unofficial fork of the Fabric mod [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) for Minecraft Forge. This mod aims to optimize the general performance of Minecraft(mob ai, game physics, chunk loading, etc..) without changing any behavior. It works **on both the client and server**, and can be installed on servers **without requiring clients to also have the mod**. With the mod installed, you can see on average a **45% improvement to server tick times**, resulting in a much leaner game.\n\nEven in single-player, your game runs an \"integrated server\" which ticks the world your player is in. Through optimizing the server-side of the game, this can free up your computer's processor to focus on other tasks, resulting in **improved frame rates and responsiveness**. For multiplayer servers, administrators can expect a sizeable improvement to tick times, allowing their hardware to support more loaded entities, chunks, and players.\n\n*(Note: Canary is stable at this point but also --issues are expected, also as mentioned above Canary is unofficial fork that means it has not been created by CaffeineMC team. So please report any issues you have to me only from here.*\n\n### Installation\n\nCanary only supports Minecraft Forge 1.18.2 and up, So make sure you have the latest version of Forge present and simply drop the mod into your mods folder, no other mods or additional setup is required!\n\n### Features\n\nCanary contains all the optimizations of Lithium, You might be curious by now as to what exactly Canary is doing in order to achieve such significant gains, and I'm happy you are! You can read about (some) of the changes below.\n\n**Physics optimizations:** Entity collision detection has seen significant improvements through reducing the collision resolution complexity for simple, cuboid blocks. A more accurate algorithm is also used to reduce the number of blocks being checked every tick, especially in cases where entities are moving very quickly.\n\n**Mob AI optimizations:** We make use of an event-based system for some tasks in order to reduce the CPU usage incurred by constantly polling the world for changes. Mob \"brains\" have also been optimized to select between different AI tasks much, much quicker than before. Comparison before and after here.\n\n**World generation optimizations:** Many calculations in vanilla's world generation are unnecessary and do not affect the final result, which gives ample opportunity for Canary to optimize this overhead away.\n\n**Chunk loading optimizations:** The temporary data structures used in block palette compaction have been changed to be much more efficient. This results in fewer TPS drops while players are exploring terrain and provides a modest boost to world load times. We also batch some verification operations to reduce unnecessary disk I/O.\n\n**Mob farm optimizations:** Mob cramming is significantly less expensive as resolving collisions between entities has been optimized to take advantage of the fact that simple boxes are involved. This makes mob farms considerably less harmful for server tick rates.\n\n**Block ticking optimizations**: has less overhead, making things such as block update settling after generating chunks and other Redstone contraptions faster. This also reduces the amount of time it takes for a block to determine if it is ticking by schedule from O(n), where n is the number of ticking blocks, to O(1), providing a significant speedup when many blocks are being ticked.\n\n**Explosion optimizations:** Many optimizations have been applied to TNT and explosions alike, reducing their associated lag without changing how they behave. In particular, ray-tracing is optimized to take advantage of the fact that multiple steps through a way will occur in the same block position, allowing us to quickly re-use the previous step's results. We also make use of a faster position tracking algorithm which avoids many excessive allocations.\n\n**Point of Interest optimizations:** Complex mob AIs in Minecraft, primarily those belonging to Villagers and Pillagers, often need to find relevant points of interest in the world in order to choose the most appropriate AI task. In vanilla, querying all points within a chunk requires 16 separate retrievals through stream-heavy code. With Canary present, this task is reduced to a single simple retrieval that makes use of a much faster (and traditional) iterator based approach, yielding anywhere from a 16-22x improvement for queries.\n\n**Data Tracker optimizations:** The internal data manager used for tracking some entity state and properties has been optimized to use flat arrays and avoid expensive locking, providing a decent boost whenever these attributes are accessed during a game tick.\n\n**Redstone Wire optimizations:** Calculating the new power level of redstone wire after a block update is costly. Reducing the number of blockstate checks without any change in behavior reduces redstone dust lag by about 35%.\n\n... And other internal improvements to help the JVM better optimize code.\n \n### Configuration\n\nMuch like Lithium, Canary makes use of an unusual configuration system which can be used to enable or disable certain patches. For more information, please read [the wiki entry](https://github.com/AbdElAziz333/Canary/wiki/Configuration-File).\n\n### Modpack Permissions\n\nMuch like Lithium, this is a free and open-source project on Modrinth, and as such-- of course you can include it in your modpack!\n\n### Issues and Feature Requests\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the bottom of the page to report bugs, crashes, and if you want to propose new features or otherwise contribute to the mod, i will gladly accept pull requests, as well!\n\nIf you want to support me, use my code **AbdElAziz333** to get 25% off your first month and enjoy playing with your friends!\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://i.imgur.com/ytD8AVA.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/AbdElAziz333)\n\n**Thanks!**","published":"2022-11-02T05:14:22.028344Z","updated":"2023-07-27T20:54:01.191504Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":94541,"followers":171,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["jArn18gq","DeZyKkoh","YLptv3gY","vLnEz4Jk","QoHgoUez","630Uuhum","UwDsOziG","9rV72WpH","2EtN3XTA","zhqljn3Q","atrfkrEJ","ICblBYXF","PypZeIuM","G9wpkcBs","yifS9jNc","fVaVgOpe","WjDymkLy","jiljfkkF","WmdwuZCo","FPHheHCc","A1AhgCn6","ZXffo9kC","TPI87JnK","zr2IEDV6","QZqtvjet","VdJ59BbS","ZrGV2F1I","xLlo3yjN","Ud24AKmW","nb6pFSvG","eXwCI6yf","nZRwdF8v","cUhhW3wi","9Zv8xPuy","DhpJ1jxs","DiE1gIxe","kTSo1GCp","FtWglNX8","l0P3FJwx","FbLb4Ucu","BXS19h1f","AASYIFl1","n72gvih6","SAnjWBGk","sIc9LXIn","SOco8NAK","5lKmJ9yT","umf6wyAx","epbUPaCx","pfEKLmDJ","7imJufXu","eei6bAjg","ObfM0BsK","h5Ls1xeD","QtErbnSX","6o7AeOrz","aInG8ARC","EoRiIRCJ","jMAxD8Cx","OQDjW5pb","2ipRmY3M","T4yRVmge","l5ovPLmS","Ky0jp694","EWj5VGbH","rdHeE0B2","cjyOKKa5","LaKiAYF7","eXCrRKVC","8eRYepVl","RvcqTsxC","V6nY8ZpR","LE99Zz6p","NBQ1tGmZ","NZE8AZVj","Oslo7xK4","b8QqzhYT","FReV3YPW","pktaNaG5","UgJanwuo","VIre5UC7"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qa2H4BS9/5e5697fc3bab569b83b10dd816f4aac396b5e677.png"},"version":{"id":"b8QqzhYT","project_id":"qa2H4BS9","author_id":"3AXCrCqA","featured":false,"name":"Canary 0.2.4 for MC 1.18.2","version_number":"mc1.18.2-0.2.4","changelog":"Fix the running behaviors are not ticked.\nFix incompatibility with modernfix mod.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-27T20:52:03.777403Z","downloads":6045,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"d97ccce5fadac58a3ebe0073ad02cac34e23d074e8a0fcaf34ef36550eafde6ea80cbef6526d7099688a4102103f3314ba15e73f3cbdc2cccd2534c9ef0df261","sha1":"6edfdd4003139c9dc1cdeb0f510559953cdc770a"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qa2H4BS9/versions/b8QqzhYT/canary-mc1.18.2-0.2.4.jar","filename":"canary-mc1.18.2-0.2.4.jar","primary":true,"size":432079,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"6JMd8Cxp","user":{"id":"3AXCrCqA","username":"AbdElAziz","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89092953?v=4","bio":"I love all people","created":"2022-05-27T22:49:23.800376Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"canary-mc1.18.2-0.2.4.jar.disabled"},"mods\\tconplanner-1.18.2-1.2.0.jar":{"sha512":"de5169601fd0eb60995fd7a04f66ba204febdc7b48cc342885d4d5bfa58159d60769955d04a5a4d991275b0c7d087a23872a0f9e26dfa932839fc13b8e69efb9","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"XYufjdjs","slug":"tinkers-planner","project_type":"mod","team":"99HlZ1W1","title":"Tinker's Planner","description":"Fully plan a Tinkers' Construct tool before making it!","body":"**Tinker's Planner** is an addon to [Tinkers' Construct](https://modrinth.com/mod/tinkers-construct) that allows you to easily preview the stats of TiCon tools with any tool parts.

Fork](https://img.shields.io/badge/This%20is%20port-Support%20the%20original!-lightgray)](https://github.com/astei/krypton)\n\nPluto is a networking stack optimization mod and unofficial fork of the Fabric mod [Krypton](https://modrinth.com/mod/krypton) for Minecraft, this mod aims to optimize the network stack of the game in order to provide better network performance. It works on both the **client and server**, It derives from work\ndone in the [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com/) and [Paper](https://papermc.io) projects.\n\n*(Note: Pluto is stable at this point but also --issues are expected, also as mentioned above Pluto is unofficial fork that means it has not been created by tuxed. So please report any issues you have to me only from [here](https://github.com/AbdElAziz333/Pluto/issues).*\n\n### Installation\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of Forge present and simply drop the mod into your mods folder, no other mods or additional setup is required!\n\n### Features\n\n- **Highly optimized Netty handlers** derived from the Velocity proxy, which I am the developer of. These handlers have sen real-world usage and extensive profiling, and strategically deploy native code where it makes the most sense.\n- **Flush consolidation** to lower server CPU usage (and reducing the impact from hardware security vulnerabilities which exploit speculative execution) and lower server tick times.\n- **Micro-optimizations** to reduce memory usage and improve packet serialization speeds.\n\n### Modpack Permissions\n\nMuch like Krypton, this is a free and open-source project on Modrinth, and as such-- of course you can include it in your modpack!\n\n### Issues and Feature Requests\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the bottom of the page to report bugs, crashes, and if you want to propose new features or otherwise contribute to the mod, i will gladly accept pull requests, as well!\n\nIf you want to support me, use my code **AbdElAziz333** to get 25% off your first month and enjoy playing with your friends!\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://i.imgur.com/ytD8AVA.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/AbdElAziz333)\n\n**Thanks!**","published":"2022-11-02T05:35:59.782416Z","updated":"2023-04-02T01:50:24.361891Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":24972,"followers":79,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["1qUaFrTP","6n0l9r2w","S15LOQft","dgFbys5v","hCIJiuqr","FfiIcIce","JtY7FSta","AuqPLrTB","dwSCE9oQ","vziDKk2u","mGdhkE7g","X0fJdY7n","NCFF2wJu","ggmiL6qf","7JnXMAAf","fyvB6FFu"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/I2K4u1Q7/503173db92aa072c1f909cd40e8e7519acfe13b1.png"},"version":{"id":"fyvB6FFu","project_id":"I2K4u1Q7","author_id":"3AXCrCqA","featured":false,"name":"Pluto 0.0.6 for MC 1.18.2","version_number":"mc1.18.2-0.0.6","changelog":"Highly recommended to update.\nThanks for SrRapero720!\n\nFixes :\n\n- Server requires client restart in the re-login.\n- Long time to join a server.\n- Incompatibility with Immersive Portals (For Forge).","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-04-02T01:50:26.390499Z","downloads":5059,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"be7d23746bee7215bf5ffa138aafbda611b5a55315256494264de5b6d710694235411a083f9aa4c758febc4773b5bccd8912e033649f4327a866d72d4e24a7fd","sha1":"e899a873360d1ed6df9b8612f7dd775b6e7efed4"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/I2K4u1Q7/versions/fyvB6FFu/pluto-mc1.18.2-0.0.6.jar","filename":"pluto-mc1.18.2-0.0.6.jar","primary":true,"size":162564,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"JXNyz1Wl","project_id":"2eT495vq","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":"b8QqzhYT","project_id":"qa2H4BS9","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"z53V2L4P","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"aBCDms9i","user":{"id":"3AXCrCqA","username":"AbdElAziz","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89092953?v=4","bio":"I love all people","created":"2022-05-27T22:49:23.800376Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"pluto-mc1.18.2-0.0.6.jar"},"mods\\Highlighter-1.18.1-1.1.2.jar":{"sha512":"c459cf82dd3589f5e60718bc132a4ceafbd8c902311626a617f3d1ea58798346aacaf1e886841b4720ca2e4813b80527c01f3c02c238b8bcef5419b1985b0dbb","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"cVNW5lr6","slug":"item-highlighter","project_type":"mod","team":"DbFpDzeZ","title":"Item Highlighter","description":"Highlights newly picked-up items.

Removing texture zooming just removes some code and has no impact. If you however want to be nit picky the mod also slightly tweaks item models in a way that could add a ouple more quads for concave item textures compared to vanilla so in that case it could very slightly worse that vanilla. This is however negligible and could only be an issue when trying to run high resolution packs\n\n- How does this work?\n\nThe base fix is simply removing texture zooming. This is extremly simple to do and immediately \"fixes up\" all those problematic gaps on models.\nFor 2d item models something else is needed as this alone creates another kind of tiny gaps in them due to the way they are generated, quad by quad. These are very tiny and they flicker so I had to fix those too. To do so I've changed the item model generator to never create a quad that encompasses a transparent pixel and instead create multiple quads for each row of solid pixel in the same direction. This allows me to slightly increase the size of all these side quads without creating new gaps in the process, thus covering all gaps seamlessly. Note that this last part only applies to forge as fabric does not seem to have such tiny lines and the models work right away with no extra quad\n\n ","published":"2022-09-13T21:58:16.905418Z","updated":"2023-06-24T14:46:17.540175Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"optional","downloads":519288,"followers":832,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["aZZZrtpR","vJ00juj2","7ainrOrH","EglYgeMq","Kfbnfh5q","i0mERlxq","ZvRvG9JE","r6uVoUxU","fbaUxdx3"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QdG47OkI/5a8203e120985d11616614e11ad7b888997000d8.png"},"version":{"id":"EglYgeMq","project_id":"QdG47OkI","author_id":"BU21lLGA","featured":false,"name":"1.8","version_number":"1.8","changelog":"check CF page","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-10-28T00:54:07.534784Z","downloads":15241,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"e237d5cf08f8c785b13265758ad1748b14e82753204eb42088a04273c4b31b11ca1d0fe92761a3a01d1a5e286d138fb57a95dba2e80740dccbd8979e4212b0e9","sha1":"ef1882c6244ffb09fed6251b647dec1ffebdca4f"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QdG47OkI/versions/EglYgeMq/modelfix-1.8.jar","filename":"modelfix-1.8.jar","primary":true,"size":26382,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19.1","1.19.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Nq0CQj6q","user":{"id":"BU21lLGA","username":"MehVahdJukaar","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24719182?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-06-21T07:42:29.648721Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"modelfix-1.8.jar"},"mods\\lazydfu-1.0-1.18+.jar":{"sha512":"16341b86d830766817a0705f3835e9eb73e095d91f1c27331e9b93f02021896f667e9ff6564b6ae2e75d265a18a930c65a5e9a75b513aa1aecbd491bb225dc9b","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"LazyDFU","description":"Makes DataFixerUpper more lazy\n","authors":["tuxed"],"version":"0.1.3","icon":"C:\\Users\\oem\\AppData\\Roaming\\com.modrinth.theseus\\caches\\icons\\c18ad8b5767f382ba67bb52dad228f5aeeda3403.png","project_type":"mod"},"file_name":"lazydfu-1.0-1.18+.jar"},"mods\\more-immersive-wires-1.18.2-1.1.2.jar":{"sha512":"5571f13413c9246ee38bffddaf643363d8b3d0c0385046a711b13cea6764e10c8bae94be6437cc87c144d1e9dbfc8dcd25c7862d1c5925c7d92485759dadb907","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"ekzqyEZL","slug":"more-immersive-wires","project_type":"mod","team":"yUpzFTmL","title":"More Immersive Wires","description":"Adds Immersive Engineering wire types for various other mods' cables.","body":"## More Immersive Wires\nThe mod [Immersive Engineering](https://modrinth.com/mod/immersiveengineering) wire types, relays and connectors for multiple mods.  \nYou can connect your AE system, RS storage network, or attach your ComputerCraft peripherals using IE wires.\n\nCurrently supported mods:  \n- [Applied Energistics 2](https://modrinth.com/mod/ae2)  \nYou can connect parts of your AE system using IE wires.

actually ticking the leaf blocks rapidly, we just remove them as soon as possible. Our mod implements this logic in the most vanilla possible way by delaying our leave checking logic to allow the game to naturally mark the leaves ready for removal. \n\nOne of the goals of Accelerated Delay was reduce the lag on clients & servers. We've achieved this by using a time based checking system and heavily reducing the particals and ticking logic on blocks.\n\n## How it works\n\nOnce the last block supporting leaves has been removed, the mod will attempt to seek out any leaves marked with the `#minecraft:leaves` tag and remove them as long as they're ready to be decayed.\n\nWe support any tree made up with the `#minecraft:logs` tag.\n\n## Why use yours over others\n\n- Less lag is basically the only differentiating factor and a greatly simplified codebase allow for a very minimal performance impact.\n- Relatively Open License\n- No complicated configs, it's either on or it's not\n- Forge & Fabric support out of the box\n\n### Why do you require the `architectury-api`?\n\nI'm lazy, stop judging me, we fire and listen on some events that it's much simpler to implement with `architectury`.

Once you have at least 12 eyes, you can follow them until you reach the Stronghold. You have to put <strong>the 12 custom eyes in the portal in order to open it</strong>. If there's a vanilla eye of ender in one of the frames, you can remove it by right clicking on it with a custom eye.</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\"><br /></span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/PuRYpVn.png\" alt=\"The Eyes\" width=\"1042\" height=\"174\" /></span><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The Eyes are a really important part of End Remastered, just like Vanilla Ender Eyes, they allow you to activate the portal to the End. However, unlike Vanilla Ender Eyes, they are not dropped by Endermen, but must be found by exploring, fighting and mining.

For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2023-12-13T09:52:16.752416Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":2129946,"followers":4027,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz","tfQSdUpc","85kC2OMr","pguEMpy9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"fs07zE6w","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":false,"name":"4.2.2

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n###

To craft these items you need to make a Rolling Mill which is a kinetic machine that is used to make rods and wires. All the recipes are available through JEI.\n\n## Content:\n- Electric Motor: Generates kinetic energy from Forge Energy, provides a ComputerCraft peripheral.\n- Alternator: Generates Forge Energy from kinetic energy.\n- Rolling Mill: Used to craft Wires and Rods.\n- Creative Generator: Generates a limitless supply of Forge Energy.\n- Connector & Wires: Wires for energy transfer.\n- Redstone Relay: Controls energy flow with Redstone.\n- Accumulator: Multiblock energy storage.\n- Portable Energy Interface: Transfer energy to and from contraptions.\n- Tesla Coil: Charges electric items, and can also be used to inflict damage to Players and Mobs.\n- Digital Adapter: Allows Computercraft computers to talk to various Create blocks (See API).\n- Biomass: Pellet, Fuel.\n- Chocolate and Honey Cake.\n- Diamond Grit Sandpaper.\n- Straw: Applied to a Blaze Burner will give it the ability to burn liquid fuels.\n- Barbed Wire block.\n- Biomass, Biomass Pellet, Sead Oil, and Bioethanol.\n- Various wires, rods, spools, and other crafting components.\n\n### Legacy Features:\n- Induction Heater (Removed in 20220710a): Heats furnaces using Forge Energy (Replaces External Heater from Immersive Engineering).\n- Charging Station (Removed in 20211122a): Charges electric items.\n- Furnace Burner (Removed in 20220709a): Furnace which doesn't require a smelting recipe to run.\n- Crude Burner (Removed in 20220709a): A Furnace Burner that is fueled by liquids such as Seed, Plant, Crude, and Creosote Oil.\n- Accumulator (Replaced with multiblock): Energy storage.\n- Overcharged Hammer: A powerful throwable melee weapon (only in 1.16).\n- Multimeter  (only in 1.16).\n\n### Added Compatibility & Integration:\n- Recipe compatibility with Simple Jetpacks 2 (Electric Jetpacks).\n- Recipe compatibility with Immersive Engineering (External Heater, Lapis Sheet pressing, Sphalerite mineral deposit, Alloys, Treated Wood).\n- Recipe compatibility with Mekanism (Rose Quartz Enriching & Metallurgic Infusing).\n- Recipe compatibility with Tinkers Construct (Alloys).\n- Recipe compatibility with Applied Energistics 2, the Tesla Coil can be used to charge Certus Quartz.\n- Integration with ComputerCraft, the Electric Motor, and more can be used as a peripheral (See API).\n\n## FAQ:\n- What is the recipe for X? - Use JEI to see the current recipes.\n- Can I use this in a modpack? - Yes, distributed with credits to the source on GitHub (Which an unmodified release has), and in accordance with the MIT license.\n- I found a bug, what do I do? - Create an issue on my GitHub page by clicking the Issues tab above or leave a comment below, please always provide, the Forge version, Create version, and Create Crafts & Additions version and a log in the event of a crash.\n- I have a suggestion, where can I be heard? - Create an issue on my GitHub page by clicking the Issues tab above or put it on Discord.\n- Can I create a language translation? - Yes, get the current translation on my Github and then create a pull request to submit your translation.\n\n## Translations:\n- en_us, sv_se\n- ko_kr thanks to KyleHeren\n- es_es thanks to

alt=\"Supplementaries Twitter\"></a>\n<hr>\n\n## 📖About 📖\n</center>\n\nSmarter Farmers is a very simple mod that makes farmers a bit less dumb\n\nFarmers can now:\n- Interact, plant and replant modded crops\n- Replant crops according to some logic. No longer will they pick the first seed they have but they'll try to replant what they just harvested instead\n- If no crop is being replanted farmers will choose a new crop to plant based on the crops around it. No more lone single patches of carrots n your wheat field!\n- Accept and pick up seeds from said crops & prevent non farmers from doing the same\n- Will equip a hoe while performing their farm task.

Hydration is more relevant than temperature, so building your base in wet biomes is more advisable than doing so in cold ones.\nThis system is also compatible with **Cold Sweat**, and will use their more precise temperature calculations if the mod is present in the pack.  \n\n### 🍖 Farmer's Delight & Co.  \n\nThe stack size for **water bottles** has been increased to **64**, to make them fit with the foods from Farmer's Delight.\nEvery food item that should quench your thirst added by farmer's delight, respite, and brewin and chewin' is integrated by default, making teas (or booze) the **best late-game hydration source**.  \n\n### ⚙ Create\n\nA new block is added if you have Create installed: the **Sand Filter**, which can purify water fed to it by pipes.  \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UdIApb3.png)  \n\n### 💧 Apple Skin  \n\nThe mod is compatible with apple skin, showing the \"quenched\" overlay if the mod is present, as well as tooltips for every item that quenches your thirst.  \n\n![](https://imgur.com/pbqR6Ea.png)\n\n##### To learn more about the mod, you can check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/ghen-git/Thirst-Mod/wiki) or the [Discord](https://discord.gg/wqfgcZCfYh)\n\n##### This mod is still very early in development, which means it's filled to the brim with bugs and glitches.

features (context-dependent style) unreliable.\n\nIf you play with content mods, I recommend also installing [Dynamic Crosshair Compat](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamiccrosshaircompat).\n\nIf you like dynamic UI elements, also check out my other mod [Auto HUD](https://modrinth.com/mod/autohud) that extends dynamic behaviour to most of the HUD.\n\nDynamicCrosshair is currently not compatible with

mod that adds dozens of unique items with complex and thoughtful mechanics. The true potential of each relic can be unlocked both when used alone, and in combination with other relics or even mods. When creating each relic, we took into account that modpack will not consist only of our mod, therefore the mod balance is automatically adjusted to the needs of the modpack, which makes Relics fits perfectly both in the vanilla-like modpack and modpack, where the numbers of health and damage is in the thousands.</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/5sPMQuK.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1117\" height=\"386\" /></span></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><span class=\" author-d-iz88z86z86za0dz67zz78zz78zz74zz68zjz80zz71z9iz90z95iyz86z4z86zmz79zz83zz83zz85zgz73zx1ez122zz86z5z84zqz66zz71z0z84zwtqyv\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Minecraft is not endless, sooner or later all game content ends and player has to entertain himself. We took this aspect into account and tried to make Relics&rsquo;s experience as fun as possible for a long time. Thanks to our leveling system and random stats, each relic will not look like another. The player is free to choose what he wants from the relic, generating a virtually unlimited number of combinations of relic sets.</span></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><span class=\" author-d-iz88z86z86za0dz67zz78zz78zz74zz68zjz80zz71z9iz90z95iyz86z4z86zmz79zz83zz83zz85zgz73zx1ez122zz86z5z84zqz66zz71z0z84zwtqyv\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/650/339/2023-04-21_08.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"832\" height=\"232\" /></span></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><span class=\" author-d-iz88z86z86za0dz67zz78zz78zz74zz68zjz80zz71z9iz90z95iyz86z4z86zmz79zz83zz83zz85zgz73zx1ez122zz86z5z84zqz66zz71z0z84zwtqyv\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\">With this mod you get:</span></div>\n<div><span class=\" author-d-iz88z86z86za0dz67zz78zz78zz74zz68zjz80zz71z9iz90z95iyz86z4z86zmz79zz83zz83zz85zgz73zx1ez122zz86z5z84zqz66zz71z0z84zwtqyv\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\">◈ 28 relics with unique and complex mechanics.

","body":"Mouse Tweaks replaces the standard RMB dragging mechanic, adds two new LMB dragging mechanics and an ability to quickly move items with the scroll wheel.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install a compatible mod loader:\n    - 1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.\n    - 1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.\n    - 1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).\n2. Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).\n\n## Modpacks\n\nFeel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.\n","published":"2021-03-20T15:55:49.895120Z","updated":"2023-10-01T09:40:10.683782Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":494370,"followers":1182,"categories":["storage","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","b1.7.3"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","modloader"],"versions":["RNWLd5dh","VmXwwpoa","ZP9EDGxB","7F7mEY80","Q3YILuAe","EGSuwm1J","q0CGibTg","ILp7UQip","475fj6e8","NanXuqPE","pmMCbsN3","Un7oJEL8","kyT0ersE","Aax1dmTi","5EvmIoqj","dXBVA16v","sjDYaHEo","stb5nE30","m0Dd8Cjy","jBovYAZR"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"q0CGibTg","project_id":"aC3cM3Vq","author_id":"On32SQVu","featured":false,"name":"[1.18+] Mouse Tweaks 2.22","version_number":"1.18-2.22-forge","changelog":"- Fixed compatibility with Replay Mod.\n- Changed how RMBTweak works to support Bundles and Bundle-like mod items.\n- RMB-dragging a Bundle with RMBTweak will \"right click\" items out of a Bundle into the slots as you're dragging over them.\n- RMB-dragging with a Bundle over items will now pick the items up into the Bundle.\n- Enabled RMBTweak by default again.\n- Added a config menu accessible from the Mods menu in Forge and from Mod Menu in Fabric.\n- Adjusted inventory-position-aware scrolling type to be a bit more intuitive.

On","description":"Carry On allows you to pick up Tile Entities and Mobs and carry them around!","body":"Ever wonder why you can carry a stack of 64 empty chests in your pocket, but you can’t move a filled one with your bare hands? Well, wonder no more!\n\nCarry On is a simple mod that improves game interaction by allowing players to pick up, carry, and place single block Tile Entities (such as Chests, Furnaces, Droppers, Spawners, and your favorite machines from other Tech Mods) using only their empty hands. No items (or pickaxes) required. States, meta data, inventory and NBT data are retained. It also allows you to carry around smaller mobs!\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n- Shift (can be rebound) + Right-Click (with Empty Hands) on any Tile Entity or mob to lift and carry\n- Right-Click to place\n\n![Carry On Demo](https://www.creeptech.net/carryon/carryondemo2.gif)\n\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/PJ4Q7tp.gif)\n\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/czlzu1s.gif)\n\n\n**Other features:**\n\n- Works with single block Tile Entities from any mod (yes, tech mods too)\n- Works with all entities (no hostile mobs in survival mode, configurable)\n- Entities can be stacked on each other (only smaller entities on top of larger ones)\n- Respects the ‘lock’ functionality so Tile Entities cannot be stolen\n- Powerful config allows you to blacklist entire mods or specific blocks, and additional customization\n- Players can only carry one Tile Entity or Mob at a time, and are prevented from other actions when carrying\n- Carrying a Tile Entity or Mob slows the player. Items with fuller inventories and larger mobs will cause additional slowness\n- Advanced scripting for modpack creators. Wiki [here](https://github.com/Tschipp/CarryOn/wiki/Scripting).\n- If you can't place down a picked up block, you can remove it from your inventory with /carryon clear\n- Players can also be carried\n\n**Config Options:**\n\n- Carry On provides a powerful config file, wiki [here](https://github.com/Tschipp/CarryOn/wiki/Model-Override-Config)\n- Specific blocks or entire mods can be blacklisted\n- An option to carry standard blocks (e.g., Dirt) can be enabled (Default = Off)","published":"2022-12-05T21:45:11.691063Z","updated":"2023-11-19T22:29:40.806053Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":161866,"followers":461,"categories":["game-mechanics","storage","transportation"],"additional_categories":["utility"],"game_versions":["1.12.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["WaUwGT7r","aPthYrcV","4taUKxre","ibq5WYnJ","IA7TXsjL","CGK8S9Jc","FS0TPQOn","HMCz7mpi","Tpvzh1n7","CS0T5Zjr","HSrAkWqH","fk6vR3rB","zFYERXVc","F6ZR4jay","QAiSN3Q8","IJ5gr5ow","cE4GdBxS","67jN6bxd","SXmDVLN0","4GE3aVyX","o4LGtvUQ","2jx3bUuL","BycIzhuF","uGbxgawj","LwNYnVxa","NyGIRVfz","1soFLh2H","gq4gg8ZY","fgecxyFN","TNZ4Ah0o","epf47Jaz","f48u7DLZ","i8cp4wxM","u8IQu6NU","TxQzQgUm","tofYc8B0","aKYuUZpd","5QeqM4nf","fg9VeABy","nc5Z9l3C","x5FGVS4q","LTOqV1Cw","iX4EV3eP","9iomDg8D","uemV3oEm","uh2S7w5K","tHTJYcot","e6FYVr4k","6pIQMDen","SgeYUS6n","edGQD16r","Mkla4B3q"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/joEfVgkn/d07cc032da5a9854489ab5ae443c91c1147792bc.png"},"version":{"id":"epf47Jaz","project_id":"joEfVgkn","author_id":"5I09DlLz","featured":false,"name":"Carry On 1.17.1.12","version_number":"1.17.1.12","changelog":"- Fixed IMC messages not being sent\n- Now respects protections more\n- Fixed crashes\n- Added entries to default blacklist\n- Fixed bug where sneaking would conflict with carrying","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-06T19:07:29.199863Z","downloads":4281,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"3873b6f842c36af75bc29d448f65df9a03c1a9da","sha512":"83593fa0d8833e1504ba23f069deaea9957d7f9e2396ebd62184932dc8872bda5dde675534a05663746364b09a13cce7e1b08f792f26f36b40d93b4e5a22ff9d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/joEfVgkn/versions/epf47Jaz/carryon-1.18.2-1.17.1.12.jar","filename":"carryon-1.18.2-1.17.1.12.jar","primary":true,"size":319432,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"4y59IILI","user":{"id":"5I09DlLz","username":"Tschipp","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11649893?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-12-05T21:43:38.882316Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"carryon-1.18.2-1.17.1.12.jar"},"mods\\dimensionviewer_1.18-1.4.0.jar":{"sha512":"657660ce2ba98d87b668cc44ba143fe5fcdf177a5c695b3c76143e2075e20c8b003a049039a51a310a76620bbc671d83dab62f04968fde29edb8f4bf80b88054","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"3aeFezQk","slug":"dimension-viewer","project_type":"mod","team":"7UGCGz20","title":"Dimension Viewer","description":"A highly customisable server-side mod for viewing which dimension each player is currently in.","body":"# Dimension Viewer\nA highly customizable server-side Minecraft Forge mod for viewing what dimension players are currently in.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ewan-Selkirk/Dimension-Viewer/main/img/DimensionViewer.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin: 0px 1rem;\">\n\n## Configuration\nBy modifying the config file, you can change the colour* of the text on a per-dimension basis, allow showing the dimension in chat messages and change the overall format of the dimension with the ability to use Minecraft text formatting such as underlining, bold and italic fonts.\n\nThe config file is located in `[world name]/serverconfig/dimensionviewer-server.toml`.

The mod includes two types of teleporters: entity teleporters and item teleporters. In order to work, both types of teleporters need to be bound to their corresponding receivers.\n\n \n\nThe teleporters in Create Teleporters run on telefluid, which is a special power source that is made by mixing chorus fruit and water. Players must obtain telefluid in order to power their teleporters, and must carefully manage their supply to ensure their teleporters remain operational.\n\n \n\nOne of the standout features of Create Teleporters is the inclusion of a custom portal that can teleport players to any location in any dimension. This feature adds a new level of exploration and discovery to the game, allowing players to easily travel to new and exciting locations.\n\n \n\nFinally, the mod includes a pocket dimension remote that sends players to a small room in a custom dimension.

You can roll into any direction you are heading (forwards, backwards, sideways, etc...)\n\nThe combat roll ability has 4 seconds cooldown by default.  (Server side configurable)\n\nCooldown of your combat roll ability can be seen on the main UI (aka HUD). (Client side configurable)\n\nExhaust (aka hunger) is added to the player upon rolling (Server side configurable)\n\nRoll ability can only be used when player is: not using item, not jumping, not swimming.\n\n**New!** Now with invulnerability frames! (Disabled by default, can be turned on at `config/combatroll/server.json5`)\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## Attributes\n\nThese new entity attributes determine the properties of the combat roll ability.\n\n`combatroll:distance` determines how far the player rolls (the default distance is 3 blocks, server configurable).

For example: \n\n`/give @s leather_helmet{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"combatroll:count\", Name:\"testing\", Amount:2, Operation:0,Slot:\"head\",UUID:[I; 66453, 79497594, -201177, -16957605]}]} 1`\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## Enchantments\nImprove various aspects of your combat roll ability with these enchantments.\n\n### Mulit-Roll\nCan be enchanted on helmets - Grants extra rolls (+1 roll / level)\n\n### Acrobat\nCan be enchanted on chests and legs - Increases the recharge speed of the roll cooldown (by +10% / level)\n\n### Longfooted\nCan be enchanted on boots - Increases the distance of your rolls (by 1 block / level).\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🔧 Configuration\n\n&zwnj;\n\n### Fabric\n\nClient side settings can be accessed via the [Mod Menu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu).\n\n### Forge\n\nClient side settings can be accessed in Main Menu &gt; Mods &gt; Combat Roll &gt; Config.\n\n### Server\n\n**Server side** configuration can be found in the `config` directory, after running the game with the mod installed.","published":"2022-09-19T17:04:44.140047Z","updated":"2023-11-01T11:37:51.803688Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":98058,"followers":264,"categories":["adventure","game-mechanics","library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["qjPNxjeI","QY3g1MPa","6Y4CdZNa","ruVouh8N","fwWMS64D","Ef4UURAJ","cNuQKeYa","bEkfuXFS","azj5HSxy","pGWBRn1i","g54fQTVc","oDqrlOkT","NjDgCyxY","VXixoSQM","UF8erTuU","Ucep0Cu5","VFPcEpGA","KYboqMGf","X1F0kcns","QCPx2IS2","LvVX8D1q","7xq1zpn0","DkP5RdK3","2YI9I4TO","EDsEsJtK","aJk5QhXt","u2ibYGVH","2Ae8EJZw","WOCP3kLf","oSQPSvZH","pzCkMdkj","h13cp5Hk","SzaC8Y3W","JrSJCgLX","qiJtKPOI","kJTOmZiq","4Kt64z82","RkJWufMO","Osxa4mmc","URzpc7Lq","ouVfwhi4","JkgJLz6x","b64nmuue","jsIwSe6h","B7ZtSwe2","iG0xPWUm","vOu5WIvs","bOQ2Cikd","mSQJJvNy","91FfnPM8","UQb9qD3J","XTopJ0Id","deyBZlUs","vaBqHK19","ljjcUkWs","81E06FMa","1QeyH5IG","8Q03X6HA","Aj08MYtw","PSEQMV1l","DYKVvo9P","js1pLjSF","slz81V0J","MzRHyyTC","gLzlXMlf","NP7Nwrwq","vdae5kTA","QiWlD1U9","hJQhKVxj","RBDMFemm","EXGDg1mc","ZFOUucav","tOGQOc87","GKj5mumX","KnHNGyLj","buCwQh9G","LNxSmECr","GmitzqXs","NhqiKzjd","Iu7dNK5J","S9W5W5gZ","n5c0ilso","yr87igvi","soyzSn1W","eVyBNuwl","cIHoyOhg"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/wGKYL7st/ec708f6b60ed75fceab14e0848e9906f99dd84e1.png"},"version":{"id":"QiWlD1U9","project_id":"wGKYL7st","author_id":"CUHgJfv9","featured":false,"name":"1.1.5+1.18.2","version_number":"1.1.5+1.18.2-forge","changelog":"No changelog was specified.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-03-08T22:14:43.934916Z","downloads":3028,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"c81512a0e3fdff9ee5500093aac1d5dbbb09b493e14438bb664b0120dc83dd71932829bbe88dc208416b1d7ad5f400e0ba17c55af4536b7ab6dc9c20d54a0713","sha1":"bac7168f9629101f7593d10afa2ac1697c53b870"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/wGKYL7st/versions/QiWlD1U9/combatroll-forge-1.1.5%2B1.18.2.jar","filename":"combatroll-forge-1.1.5+1.18.2.jar","primary":true,"size":198825,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"ZbWG3eJW","project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"gedNE4y2","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"oKdlkn0S","user":{"id":"CUHgJfv9","username":"ZsoltMolnarrr","name":"Molnár Zsolt","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4989469?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-07-04T18:48:27.207892Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"combatroll-forge-1.1.5+1.18.2.jar"},"mods\\ControlEngineering-0.1.1.jar":{"sha512":"bb7e250a6985610ffac60c7e7bf4299cffcf1dee1914e809fa229da215b399f3ebaf62c010eed23d30a143dd8d1dd1e42ef7152be4f994f609ceb00afff90ab8","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"x4E7exfQ","slug":"control-engineering","project_type":"mod","team":"hfDuH0mg","title":"Control Engineering","description":"Redstone control and logic for Immersive Engineering","body":"![](https://github.com/malte0811/ControlEngineering/raw/main/images/desc-demo.png)\n\nControl Engineering is an addon for Immersive Engineering focusing on redstone control and automation.

Adds an option to choose the crafting result if more than one is available.","body":"Polymorph is a mod that solves recipe conflicts by letting players choose between all potential\noutputs shared by the same ingredients.\n\nWith a sufficiently large amount of mods, recipe conflicts are a common occurrence and the\nresponsibility for resolving these usually falls on the user or modpack developer, using datapacks\nor other tools to ensure that each recipe is unique.\n\nPolymorph offers an alternative solution, allowing all possible crafting and smelting recipes to\nco-exist regardless of conflicts.\n\n## Features\n\n### Crafting\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/TkWswkG/polymorph.gif)\n\nWhen a group of ingredients matches more than one recipe, a button will appear above the output\nslot. Pushing this button will show a list of all possible results and selecting one will change the\ncrafting output to match. Polymorph will also remember the last selection as long as the ingredients\ndon't change, so repeated crafting actions are possible on the same selection.\n\n### Smelting\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/QX9MNYM/polymorph-furnacedemo.gif)\n\nWhen a valid input matches more than one output, a button will appear above the output slot. Pushing\nthis button will show a list of all possible results with the currently selected result highlighted\nin green. Selecting one of the listed results will change the smelting output to match. This\nselection will be saved to the block itself and persist across world loading and unloading.\n\n### Smithing\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/GTCgL3S/smithingconflicts.png)\n\nExactly like the crafting screen, a button will appear above the output slot when a valid input matches more than one\noutput. Upon selection, the output will change to match.\n\n### Commands\n\nTo assist identifying potential conflicts, there's a command `/polymorph conflicts` that will try to identify recipes\nthat conflict with each other and outputs a list of them to your logs folder. Currently, the command will scan crafting,\nsmelting, blasting, smoking, and smithing recipes.\n\n### Mod Integration\n\n**Note for 1.19.x: Many of these integrations have not been implemented yet on 1.19.x.**\n\n**Just Enough Items**\n\nUpon selecting a recipe to transfer from the Just Enough Item screen, the output will automatically change to match the\nselection if there is more than one possible output.\n\n**Modded Support**\n\nMany crafting tables that are simply variants of the vanilla crafting table will automatically be compatible. Other\ntypes of support may or may not be compatible; below is a list of all mods that Polymorph has specific integration with\nand has already been tested for functionality.\n\n- [Applied Energistics 2](https://modrinth.com/mod/ae2)\n  - ME Crafting Terminal\n  - ME Pattern Terminal\n- [CraftingCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/craftingcraft)\n  - Portable Crafting\n  - Inventory Crafting\n- [Crafting Station](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafting-station)\n  - Crafting Station\n- [Cyclic](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cyclic)\n  - Crafter\n  - Workbench\n- [FastFurnace](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastfurnace)\n  - Furnace\n  - Blasting Furnace\n  - Smoker\n- [FastWorkbench](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastworkbench)\n  - Crafting Table\n- [Iron Furnaces](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/iron-furnaces)\n  - All furnace variants\n- [Pretty Pipes](https://modrinth.com/mod/pretty-pipes)\n  - Crafting Terminal\n- [Refined Storage](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/refined-storage)\n  - Crafting Grid\n  - Pattern Grid\n- [Refined Storage Addons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/refined-storage-addons)\n  - Wireless Crafting Grid\n- [Simple Storage Network](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-storage-network)\n  - Storage Request Table\n- [Sophisticated Backpacks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sophisticated-backpacks)\n  - Crafting Upgrade\n  - Smelting Upgrade\n- [Tinkers' Construct](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-construct)\n  - Crafting Station\n- [Tom's Storage](https://modrinth.com/mod/toms-storage)\n  - Crafting Terminal\n\nPlease request support by opening an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Polymorph/issues).\n\n## Affiliates\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://i.ibb.co/1G4QPdc/bh-illusive.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/illusive)\n","published":"2023-02-03T20:08:37.444573Z","updated":"2023-12-05T07:44:23.596047Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":189841,"followers":238,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["diy4s2XO","66Bkdq05","68l9BR3j","bT9w3gh5","hR8YtS8a","gxwQtnsA","vAv92Cl4","vuRsKlbz","cnPRpn78","tLFw14o5","haoNzeyv","750iJ3hO","rect6WEh","aYxyXMzJ","ChHxCoAb","STYYlkp8","wN8G3kAN","skUakdXR","uAleZkbS","SNlci35k","GKZ6KVfs","6Nyu412V","VQtXcHcR","bIDSNOm5","UlRasi89","l15iQHMn","AWwJD7yS","7L5hC81R","zncS6GGa","pJZr4yc3","8zhVFKEL","Sj0OPjRM","2BAp032A","FBfg7una","E4b6m0sQ","GcFD377O","km82tZAr"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tagwiZkJ/ed244c5829bde539763c7fffb55cb3194a349d66.png"},"version":{"id":"zncS6GGa","project_id":"tagwiZkJ","author_id":"zbpHS3ry","featured":false,"name":"polymorph-forge-1.18.2-0.49","version_number":"1.18.2-0.49","changelog":"## [1.18.2-0.49] - 2023.07.08\n### Changed\n- Allow loading on JEI versions below 10 [#225](https://github.com/illusivesoulworks/polymorph/issues/225)\n### Fixed\n- Fixed player crafting menu integrations [#226](https://github.com/illusivesoulworks/polymorph/issues/226)\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-09T04:59:01.568407Z","downloads":3576,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"8bcd764f04e94e1298d36098f99dfa3a57c26f60d196f72435878a696b20c3b40c6988fbb43771d4ce81875bb8c0806063cdd852b7a369d2eaed1e66e3228dfe","sha1":"6712291d0bc6e5c123e3fc8742d0ea12430c22d3"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tagwiZkJ/versions/zncS6GGa/polymorph-forge-1.18.2-0.49.jar","filename":"polymorph-forge-1.18.2-0.49.jar","primary":true,"size":259839,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha1":"0c7e2e73ae26cc894572157562ec5d1e9dca2206","sha512":"7422dc823c72d1ce49be1059e2af684c21af14e4bc9d7918aef69287adbf2196b933bf1914a8feee7b815413c941e65a00614079815b4d3743b7a3eb58e99ad0"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tagwiZkJ/versions/zncS6GGa/polymorph-forge-1.18.2-0.49-sources.jar","filename":"polymorph-forge-1.18.2-0.49-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":163106,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"IyMJnv3l","user":{"id":"zbpHS3ry","username":"TheIllusiveC4","name":"C4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29991504?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2023-02-03T00:08:26.219982Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"polymorph-forge-1.18.2-0.49.jar"},"mods\\cgm-1.3.3-1.18.2.jar":{"sha512":"3d18396a6a091e92a0dc757b931772501b877398043ba9c2a01e44c20687fea8d46b887595259d1e98d7842e8119a125f6e2a05932cd629706994facc5e57b14","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"MrCrayfish's Gun Mod","description":"MrCrayfish's Gun Mod adds in simple and straight forward weapons into Minecraft.

CPUs with 8 or less threads), you may have noticed that Minecraft takes up 100% of the CPU when loading into the title screen, causing cursor stutter and makes multitasking painfully difficult. Smooth Boot (Reloaded) solves this problem completely, and loading should be much smoother and potentially faster as well.\n\n### Features\n\nChange amount of threads used for loading\nChange priority of threads used by Minecraft\n\n### How the mod works\n\nMinecraft uses executors to run multithreaded tasks. The problem is that the tasks that are ran during loading are quite heavy on the CPU, so it leads to 100% CPU usage. And, some of the tasks do not necessarily benefit from multithreading. Smooth Boot fixes these problems by change the parameters of the executors, including the number of threads they use and the priority of each thread.\n\nFor more information, please read the [Smooth Boot (Reloaded) wiki](https://github.com/AbdElAziz333/SmoothBoot-Reloaded/wiki).\n\n### Modpack Permissions\n\nSmooth Boot (Reloaded) is a free and open-source project on Modrinth, and as such-- of course you can include it in your modpack!\n\n### Issues and Feature Requests\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the bottom of the page to report bugs, crashes, and if you want to propose new features or otherwise contribute to the mod, i will gladly accept pull requests, as well!\n\nIf you want to support me, use my code **AbdElAziz333** to get 25% off your first month and enjoy playing with your friends!\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://i.imgur.com/ytD8AVA.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/AbdElAziz333)\n\n**Thanks!**","published":"2022-11-02T05:54:53.998919Z","updated":"2023-08-06T14:17:25.018351Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":72748,"followers":109,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["e9Hq3hbv","3yzqBh3Y","qmq8DyRI","YXklcDpN","CSAWSThG","FpT1xZyZ","iGVkOHlW"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/z53V2L4P/72c932a650b6ca3830a1dd82ee86eb7f05f589ef.png"},"version":{"id":"qmq8DyRI","project_id":"z53V2L4P","author_id":"3AXCrCqA","featured":false,"name":"Smooth Boot (Reloaded) 0.0.2 for MC 1.18.2","version_number":"mc1.18.2-0.0.2","changelog":"This update fixes the updates checker spam. now the updates checker should work correct.

Gameplay is centered around creating magical flowers and devices using Mana, the power of the earth. Botania is fully playable as a standalone mod (and is designed as such), but it functions just well in conjunction with other mods.\n\nThe mod focuses on automation, but without elements that make it feel grindy-- systems can be thought out and designed, rather than built blindly from blueprints in JEI or a wiki.\n\n**Botania's design philosophy**\n\n* No pipes, wires, etc-- they're boring and overdone;\n* No GUIs-- interact with everything in-world;\n* No numbers-- players shouldn't try to minmax everything;\n* Keep all resources as renewable as possible;\n* Provide pleasing visuals, despite using only two different particle effects.\n\n**Botania's goals**\n\n* Break the mold of mods being means to ends-- be engaging in gameplay as well as in rewards;\n* Deliver fun and balanced gameplay without forcing players to grind;\n* Incentivize sandbox gameplay and allow players to create fun contraptions;\n* Create an overall immersive experience.\n\n---\n\n# Learn more about Botania

Compared to vanilla, Better Fortresses are much larger, more complex, and more rewarding. Each fortress is comprised of three parts — the bridge networks, the Keep, and the Lava Halls that extend deep underground.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>YUNG's Better Nether Fortresses also includes built-in Create compatibility!</b> If you're using Create, certain parts of the fortress have a chance of spawning using Create pieces. Note that this is an optional feature — Create is not required to run this mod. Be sure to use the latest release of Create for your Minecraft version! Note that this is for 1.19.2+ only.\n</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/omRqM-gZBAg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3wUhXJJ.png\" alt=\"Compatibility\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nYUNG's Better Nether Fortresses is intended to be fully compatible with every worldgen mod, including:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Ocean Monuments\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-ocean-monuments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Ocean Monuments</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Witch Huts\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-witch-huts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Witch Huts</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Extras\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-extras\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Extras</a></li>\n<li>Infernal Expansion, Better Nether & other Nether biome mods</li>\n<li>Apocalyptic Fortress: The AF fortress will spawn alongside the Better Fortress</li>\n<li>Bygone Nether: Better Fortresses will spawn instead of Bygone Nether's enhanced vanilla fortress</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/a49IMQJ.png\" /><br />\n<a title=\"Get 25% off your server with code YUNGNICKYOUNG at Bisect Hosting!\" href=\"https://bisecthosting.com/yung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nQRs7ZP.png\" alt=\"Use code YUNGNICKYOUNG with Bisect Hosting for 25% off!\" width=\"1344\" height=\"400\" /></a></p>","published":"2023-02-19T23:44:10.212939Z","updated":"2023-09-29T21:57:26.377036Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":213827,"followers":556,"categories":["adventure","decoration","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["Ge5jWFMt","LC6CBpn9","deDT156J","8Gq5f3b9","NySrIdMV","KAarwq7Z","kWtjzB64","uol0Ji2G","CogRXOHi","16pSLk6u","CthwWOrc","N2yKMcSO","gTTPcjUR","XzRYWtHN","tS9cnHTd","f3PibvQR","W4uRBVaV","9iPMgrMe","449b2DDy","YouhzPUf","iYszV4T0","RmyDSPdb","fQyD1cxI","kuHlZxVW","vKRSJIfJ","lrZS6PH1"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Z2mXHnxP/c89b02a675b204bfbe1d7e494769e425355e23f9.png"},"version":{"id":"XzRYWtHN","project_id":"Z2mXHnxP","author_id":"HCGwycZf","featured":false,"name":"[1.18.2] v1.0.0 (Forge)","version_number":"1.18.2-Forge-1.0.0","changelog":"Official 1.18.2 release!","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-03-08T09:59:25.812453Z","downloads":9199,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"13997d079b310f5732022b380f344af9210cdaea","sha512":"80049d4abef26b876fefd2f5a2d7395e3a2c146b1d09b5509ff38b070b9543d0c7c99bec849cfe9bb789219cf545dbc263c5767679223666fe859fca5e445a63"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Z2mXHnxP/versions/XzRYWtHN/YungsBetterNetherFortresses-1.18.2-Forge-1.0.0.jar","filename":"YungsBetterNetherFortresses-1.18.2-Forge-1.0.0.jar","primary":true,"size":824584,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"YZE1pnbT","project_id":"Ua7DFN59","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"5dSGn2do","user":{"id":"HCGwycZf","username":"YUNGNICKYOUNG","name":"Nick Young","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/HCGwycZf/f4ec4b86f9778f12367fbd3a3e9f9e6af6830bee.png","bio":"Mr. Better Minecraft","created":"2022-11-13T01:46:47.603854Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"YungsBetterNetherFortresses-1.18.2-Forge-1.0.0.jar"},"mods\\player-animation-lib-forge-1.0.2+1.18.jar":{"sha512":"9d91dbcc55a32f0130fd324ce2384daf0f202b5cf88a6387595c89a88358a0dc4df3ed0e31a152ef8ec39db483632532b368fcb89ca8f3d2e2de597535cacd6b","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"gedNE4y2","slug":"playeranimator","project_type":"mod","team":"f913Xl1r","title":"playerAnimator","description":"animate the player","body":"# Player animation library,  \n## animate the player using keyframes.\n\n\nFor users/modpack devs, just put the jar into the mods folder.  \n\nFor mod developers, you may find more details [here -

Citadel, being a Library, does not add many features by itself, but rather provides a frame work for other mods when it comes to animating entities, loading .tbl Tabula and .obj Waveront models, and for keeping track of entity properties. Citadel's predecessor, LLibrary, will no longer be updated from 1.12.2, and from now on all of my mods will use Citadel. Citadel's code base is largely derived from LLibrary, and the code is used with permission from Gegy1000, the maintainer of LLibrary and its author in recent versions.\n\n \n\nIn versions 1.6.3 and above, there is also a config option for changing the cap on how many mobs spawn on chunk generation. This is useful when used with the many mob mods that require Citadel, as without changing this they can make it quite difficult to find vanilla mobs.\n\n \n\nDevelopers who want to use Citadel can read [the guide on how to add it to their development environment](https://github.com/Alex-the-666/Citadel/wiki/Getting-Started).","published":"2023-11-03T16:25:45.246822Z","updated":"2023-11-07T21:28:11.829194Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":31308,"followers":41,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["AhrngqR9","l54hCYzm","jWcSsP5K","LOHm0ffg","ge8ra0kG","u3vg28FG","AEa5lIzx","l1j29UHl","1xvYIdqx","aOl88G8l","k2akMR9x"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/jJfV67b1/dea486e5291c6f8ca8813a22e1fa32fa14a4a47f.png"},"version":{"id":"ge8ra0kG","project_id":"jJfV67b1","author_id":"iBpwljlP","featured":false,"name":"Citadel 1.11.3","version_number":"1.11.3","changelog":"release for 1.18.2","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-03T17:07:17.605106Z","downloads":4238,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"e68dc01266a887238e2f26fba9534d78be6d816b34985c3d84a924f8110c1cb88d59f943e9be60900323985d4bab13f8d73f23afea02cc8a0b1b3050448df1c6","sha1":"ca5d46c752f10dae0d77d41a52527f6eacd1895e"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/jJfV67b1/versions/ge8ra0kG/citadel-1.11.3-1.18.2.jar","filename":"citadel-1.11.3-1.18.2.jar","primary":true,"size":503137,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"rByA3asR","user":{"id":"iBpwljlP","username":"AlexModGuy","name":"AlexModGuy","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/iBpwljlP/921ad78a793efff6d03b582fa3dc1f06bb237426.jpeg","bio":"aka Alex Mobiles, Alexander Caverns, Alexthe668\n\nhttps://github.com/AlexModGuy","created":"2023-11-03T16:23:16.718366Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"citadel-1.11.3-1.18.2.jar"},"mods\\Tinkers-Thinking-0.1.1.0.jar":{"sha512":"0d05602b786529516acc3a621c37b08c2c13bd73907488d677d882eb4adcd0edeaa2013fb3e26632bab8b0b5bccc6478a46126081b14efbe4638f87b07b3d9d8","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"yMtiecO6","slug":"tinkers-thinking","project_type":"mod","team":"WAztD7RB","title":"Tinkers' Thinking","description":"An addon mod that add some item for Tinkers' Construct","body":"Tinkers' Thinking is an addon mod for [Tinkers' Construct](https://modrinth.com/mod/tinkers-construct),This mod includes many related features, including :\n- More staffs,made by quartz,magma,clay,amethyst and even blood,they all have their own speciality\n\n- Pails,lager than vanilla bucket,can  be modifiered as well.\n\n- Some modifiers\n\n- Two new materials--Dusk and Soupium,they both are slime material.\n\n- Paxel,a versatile mining tool.

Developers:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; white-space: pre;\"><strong>This guide should only be used if you are a developer wanting to using Blueprint in your mod. If you're a player, you may disregard this guide.</strong><br />Adding Blueprint to your mod is quite simple! First off you need to add Blueprint as a dependency to access the library in code. To do so, add the following into your <code>build.gradle</code>: <br /><br /><code>\nrepositories {<br />\n    maven {<br />\n        url = \"https://maven.jaackson.me\"<br />\n    }<br />\n}<br />\n<br />\ndependencies {<br />\n    implementation fg.deobf(\"com.teamabnormals:blueprint:&lt;version&gt;\")<br />\n}\n      </code><br /> <br />Next you need to add it as a dependecy on Forge to make your mod require Blueprint when loading. In your <code>mods.toml</code> add the following block to the file:<br /><br /><code>\n[[dependencies.&lt;modId&gt;]]<br />\n    modId = \"blueprint\"<br />\n    mandatory = true<br />\n    versionRange = \"[&lt;version&gt;,)\"<br />\n    ordering = \"BEFORE\"<br />\n    side = \"BOTH\"\n      </code><br /><br />Replace <code>&lt;version&gt;</code> in the examples above with the version on you want. For example, <code>1.17.1-4.0.0</code> will give us <code>blueprint-1.17.1-4.0.0.jar</code>. The example for the <code>mods.toml</code> is targeting the version selected and any versions beyond. If you want to target it differently, you may want to read up on the <code>mods.toml</code> spec. </span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/U7uo5Va.png\" width=\"1344\" height=\"48\"

This means it can be used alongside other mods that add inventory features, such as Quark or Inventory Sorter, without having to worry about clashes in functionality. As no default behaviour is overriden by this mod, it can be used Plug-and-Play without having to worry about configurations first.\n\nThis mod does not add inventory sorting. If you want sorting alongside this mod, I recommend Inventory Sorter.\n\n## Features\n\n- Control-click an item to only quick-move a single item instead of the entire stack\n- Shift-control click an item to quick-move all stacks of that item type (e.g. all cobblestone from a chest into your inventory)\n- Hold shift and move over items to quick-move them without having to click each individually\n- Optional on client and server. Only those who want to use it need to install it, and if the server doesn't have it installed, it will still work for clients who do have it installed.","published":"2022-06-14T20:24:18.877274Z","updated":"2023-12-08T14:22:50.682599Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":59838,"followers":163,"categories":["management","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["u0meKHWd","qurP2LEN","k0UlaXy2","Mb2H5kiP","GgboLVZ1","5bBK4kBC","T1xppYnd","U04ihNtQ","MuIEKp2S","QGAiEYcR","xDvKbEhw","affoRKoi","X1eYdTbT","aOZpEPpI","Hp5PybJZ","Xn6HIl5u","zjHwasp6","xtvEA1dN","jrXiJQMT","HC3nUQaZ","cRTkO1l6","P1zemQtN","sKaQolsQ","tTL1tO3G","KN08crcd","qRfRBQBE","K81SThl2","KOhB5E94","2NqKT97A","gr1uM5Xg","dGEvlIEE"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Boon8xwi/469cace78935b118f2c713b44ca9e85efcb42c39.png"},"version":{"id":"QGAiEYcR","project_id":"Boon8xwi","author_id":"WE4nCeiO","featured":false,"name":"4.0.3+forge-1.18.2","version_number":"4.0.3+forge-1.18.2","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-02-26T13:36:08.263099Z","downloads":685,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"3552d0f2dd07b649b55e66069bea05b66adffb90312c03715b5bf1130d8d179e793bb974e953a41a243373ad975691110feff51d23f95ac4fd66afde750b18bb","sha1":"e4640eb6f089cf8c6ad8a4b56c53dc0afe74d232"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Boon8xwi/versions/QGAiEYcR/inventoryessentials-forge-1.18.2-4.0.3.jar","filename":"inventoryessentials-forge-1.18.2-4.0.3.jar","primary":true,"size":130452,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"RAATKbAN","project_id":"MBAkmtvl","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"M7X5cRU0","user":{"id":"WE4nCeiO","username":"BlayTheNinth","name":"BlayTheNinth","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1933180?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-02-28T14:04:06.205061Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"inventoryessentials-forge-1.18.2-4.0.3.jar"},"resourcepacks\\Lopy-Create-Sophisticated-Backpacks.zip":{"sha512":"3f4ed5bc383a28490ddcf43f950c5090e1c75becc7627e3547d82851b3c218c556411cd9d497e9d0d971f0e093b623aa242b12f2bb8f0f94df94b9ad813efb15","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":null,"description":null,"authors":[],"version":null,"icon":"C:\\Users\\oem\\AppData\\Roaming\\com.modrinth.theseus\\caches\\icons\\a4997b8d07ea861858bce34a6219121bae6c835c.png","project_type":"resourcepack"},"file_name":"Lopy-Create-Sophisticated-Backpacks.zip"},"mods\\create-1.18.2-0.5.1.f.jar":{"sha512":"d2b8baa716f8804bb4c8258fd3dd2e537f106f0520e28165fbbee1fb321b6fd2716ccc25877f1e8ab9cb784e01226ab09ce630afff45eba991e69e07ce516bf6","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"LNytGWDc","slug":"create","project_type":"mod","team":"yyROG8qL","title":"Create","description":"Aesthetic Technology that empowers the Player","body":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rR8W-f9YhYA\" height=\"358\" width=\"638\"></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n## Installation Requirements\n\n<p><a href=\"https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/KAgud6s.png\" width=\"160\" /></a><a href=\"https://neoforged.net/\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/90zvX3m.png\" width=\"160\" /></a></p>\n<p>This version of Create runs on <a href=\"https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/\">Forge</a> and <a href=\"https://neoforged.net/\">NeoForge</a>.

Right click with a palette to paint on an easel.</p>\n<p>Added <strong>importing/exporting</strong> paintings to a file using commands. (/paintexport &lt;filename&gt; and /paintimport &lt;filename&gt;)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can import/export paintings between worlds and servers.</li>\n<li>Paintings are imported from and exported to a \"paintings\" folder inside your minecraft directory.</li>\n<li>In order to import a painting in survival mode, you need to hold an empty canvas and a full palette on your hands.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Added a <strong>brush opacity</strong> meter. Using this, you can basically mix colors on the canvas itself!</p>\n<p>The canvas and palette in the GUI can now be <strong>moved</strong>. Move them out of the way to see your reference objects!</p>\n<p>Added helpful <strong>tooltips</strong> for some parts of the painting GUI (can be toggled on and off easily)</p>\n<p>Item textures are tweaked, palette texture now shows how many basic colors it has.</p>\n<p>The game now remembers the last color you had selected when you close the GUI, so you don't have to reselect it when you reopen it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>New in 1.16.4-1.1:</strong></h3>\n<p>There is now a <strong>color picker</strong> tool on <strong>full palettes</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Click its icon to switch to color picking</li>\n<li>Then click and hold to pick a color on the canvas and bring it to one of the custom color slots on the palette</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/2dcsjdZ/color-picker.gif\" alt=\"Color picker\" width=\"588\" height=\"331\" /></p>\n<p>There are also some <strong>sound effects</strong> now, because it was too boring to paint in silence.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Usage Guide</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>First you need to craft (or get from the creative inventory) a palette and a canvas. Crafting recipes are given below.</li>\n<li>When crafting a palette, any combination of dyes will do, but you need at least one dye.</li>\n<li>You can then fill the palette with other dyes if you want.</li>\n<li>There are currently four kinds of canvases. The basic one is 1 block sized. The others are 1x2, 2x1 and 2x2 block sized.</li>\n<li>Using a canvas (by itself) with right-click lets you view its content.</li>\n<li>Using a palette (by itself) lets you open the palette interface, where you can mix colors to create custom ones.</li>\n<li>Using a canvas in one hand and a palette on the other lets you open both interfaces at once, where you can paint on the canvas using the colors on your palette. You can mix colors here as well.</li>\n<li>Another option is to place the canvas on an easel and right click the easel with a palette at hand.</li>\n<li>The color mixing rules work the same way as the vanilla leather armor dyeing mechanic.</li>\n<li>Change the brush size or opacity with the mouse wheel or by clicking on the GUI element</li>\n<li>Undo mistakes with the CTRL+Z shortcut</li>\n<li>After painting a canvas, you can use it on a wall similar to vanilla paintings to hang it on the wall.</li>\n<li>Hitting the hanged canvas or breaking a block it rests on will drop it back as an item.</li>\n<li>Sign a painting to give it a name and make it unchangeable.</li>\n<li>Copy signed paintings by crafting them together with an empty canvas of the same shape.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Crafting Recipes</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/Vpf9MsM/canvas-craft.png\" alt=\"Crafting a canvas\" width=\"400\" height=\"159\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/7rwQHrr/long-canvas-craft.png\" alt=\"Crafting long canvas\" width=\"400\" height=\"142\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/dByhxvw/tall-canvas-craft.png\" alt=\"Crafting tall canvas\" width=\"400\" height=\"145\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/26jnbYv/large-canvas-craft.png\" alt=\"Crafting a large canvas\" width=\"400\" height=\"134\" /></p>\n<p>To craft a palette, you need at least one kind of dye:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/7Xy8959/palette-craft.png\" alt=\"Crafting a palette\" width=\"400\" height=\"134\" /></p>\n<p>You can fill an existing palette with other dyes later:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/L8V5BsS/palette-fill.png\" alt=\"Filling a palette\" width=\"400\" height=\"132\" /></p>\n<p>You can copy signed paintings:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/PW9LKrG/copying-recipe.png\" alt=\"Copying a signed painting\" width=\"400\" height=\"132\" /></p>\n<h5>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Crafting an easel:</span></h5>\n<h5><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/jWg0Xkx/java-zva-Bwzjr8-A.png\" alt=\"Easel recipe\" width=\"400\" height=\"178\" /></h5>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Community</h4>\n<p>There is a <a href=\"https://discord.gg/kAXdzKGXtW\">Discord server</a> now, where you can share your creations with the world!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>About shaders:</h4>\n<p>The latest versions (1.18.2, 1.19.2 and above) seem to work fine with custom shaders, but there is no guarantee that it will work with every shader.

takes Minecraft's 1.18 massive world generation overhaul, and turns it up to eleven.\n\n![terralith_banner_squashed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224816673-7f074733-da85-4673-a7b0-3362651c4dbd.png)\n\n## Notes\n- Terralith is *technically* compatible with William Wyther's Overhauled Overworld, Biomes O' Plenty, and Oh The Biomes You'll Go; but it requires Terrablender, which screws with the biome distribution\n- Terralith is compatible with Tectonic, if you use [Apollo](https://github.com/ApolloDatapacks)'s [Terratonic](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/terratonic/)\n- Do not add this to an existing world - reset yours first, or use a new world\n- View the structures and biomes per seed using [jacobsjo](https://github.com/jacobsjo)'s [Minecraft Datapack Map](https://map.jacobsjo.eu/)\n\n## Description\n### Biomes\nTerralith adds over 95 brand new biomes, as well as updating almost every vanilla biome with new and improved features. There are also new terrain types: canyons, shattered biomes, floating islands, deep ocean trenches, and much, much more.\n\n**Yellowstone** is one of Terralith's staple biomes - a simple and beautiful landscape, based on the real life US National Park. Among the list of realistic biomes are **Yosemite Cliffs**, **Shield**, and many more depending on what you're looking for in a biome. **Highlands** and its variants offer a flat surface to create on - builders can imagine anything from huge mega cities to small simple cottages. Adventurers can explore the breath-taking **Volcanic Peaks** and discover the beautiful **Desert Oases**.\n\nWhile realistic biomes can remind us of the beautiful planet we live on, Terralith offers a plunge into the world of fantasy as well. Adventurers can wander through the purple and mystical **Moonlight Grove** and **Amethyst Rainforest**, or climb the unforgiving cliffs of the **Scarlet Mountains**. If determined, sailers can find the mysterious **Mirage Isles**, or even the elusive and nostalgic **Alpha Islands**. Terralith encourages imagination to run wild here.\n\nIf you feel the surface is too face, have no fear - custom caves lurk beneath your feet! Similar to Minecraft's Lush Cave, the **Underground Jungle** is full of foliage, and rarely some old abandoned houses. Other caves, like **Infested** and **Fungal Caves** are overgrown with spiders and fungi! If you dig super deep, you could stumble upon a sister to the Deep Dark: the **Frostfire Caves** are dangerous and menacing. Beware!\n\n### Structures\nTo tie all of Terralith's magnificent biomes together are it's structures. The ominous tall **Spire** pierces the sky in the iciest biomes. Rarely, you can find **Fortified Villages** in the plains and desert - the villagers have progressed quite far as a society! Finally, if you find yourself lost at night, cold and hungry, you might stumble into the warm protection of the simple Glacial Hut.\n__ __\n\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n    ","published":"2022-11-13T21:48:54.507121Z","updated":"2023-12-08T18:45:45.608403Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":285684,"followers":1107,"categories":["worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["Q9qUUqA7","Wd3Co0mZ","81tshMIZ","Xf5mFGCS","jUK1mCz3","1latp88m","pNFzTzQd","mLdNNka6","K3S6BASh","aYOzrVFZ","Y4i2gvLB","D0hKeWDQ","JT2esX5R","8N8lLvTW","34PhE3zd","2w1uZoRC","PNByHzei","WZvndtxX","UJtMNPNx","Rq2BBA8A","hYoo0DKV","CDrDiFNK","qFd4s3fV","FOe2l0tx","IWVbiEbl","1hOeraaL","4KrRTVvQ","WgDuoe1K","xm11wemG","FgvUosFH","zA1qYB0L","6DoFR4md"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8oi3bsk5/34c751cc804839ed3c1d9f21dfd53d98368fedfc.png"},"version":{"id":"6DoFR4md","project_id":"8oi3bsk5","author_id":"oRXQvVNJ","featured":true,"name":"v2.2.6 ~ 1.18.2","version_number":"2.2.6","changelog":"# Terralith 2.2.6\n- Fixed crash that would occur when not using Terrablender compatibility mode","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-08T18:45:49.749794Z","downloads":499,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"ee149d24d503dd71ab8598f91cc8d2f4168fd81b","sha512":"8f04e43220e606659da4c4077425855e550262c6eba4797e31081120620b769b09e687a087ca8da16e1a380458f830f96941250c0745504fd7012926d69221af"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8oi3bsk5/versions/6DoFR4md/Terralith_1.18.2_v2.2.6.jar","filename":"Terralith_1.18.2_v2.2.6.jar","primary":true,"size":3157707,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"TDwrdjSl","project_id":"BMKSAGRn","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"cl223EMc","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"L2q5L80c","user":{"id":"oRXQvVNJ","username":"Stardust","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/oRXQvVNJ/97f7c767b3b6c78eafb51a2e17f04b36da5d294d.jpeg","bio":null,"created":"2022-11-13T21:48:01.983224Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"L2q5L80c","user":{"id":"SR8MIsEo","username":"catter1","name":"catter1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63272345?v=4","bio":"Technical Lead for Stardust Labs.

You are allowed to use it, you do not need to ask for permission, in fact permission requests will usually be ignored. When using the mod, please use the Curse/CurseForge, Modrinth, or GitHub download and do not rehost the files.\n\nAny modpack which uses Tinkers' Construct takes full responsibility for user support queries.\n\nFor anyone else, we only support official builds from Curse/Curseforge, Modrinth, and GitHub. No custom built jars. We also do not take bug reports for outdated builds of Minecraft.\n\nThis project currently has builds for 1.18.2+ along with 1.6.4, 1.7.10, 1.12.2, and 1.16.5. If you are using a Minecraft version other than that which has a Tinkers release, make a request on our discord and I will upload the older build.\n\n\n## Getting Started\nTinkers' Construct is a mod about putting tools together in a wide variety of ways, then modifying them until they turn into something else. The tools never disappear and can be named and changed to your heart's desire. Once you make them, they're yours forever. Many different materials can be used to make your tools.\n\nThis mod includes many related features, including:\n* Part builders, tinker stations, and modifier workstations for building and modifying your tools\n* The melter, alloyer, smeltery, and foundry for working with molten metals\n* Slime islands generating as part of the overworld, nether, and end, granting access to 5 different slime colors\n* Slimy geodes spawning deep underground\n* Cobalt ore in the nether\n\nTo get started, craft Materials and You then follow the introduction steps. We will work on getting a better description here on Modrinth in the future - did not want to copy an outdated description from CurseForge.\n\n\n## Credits\n\n### Tinkers' Construct 3\n\n* KnightMiner

Torch</strong> adds three kinds of very powerful torches that prevent mobs from spawning in a huge area. Only natural spawns will be prevented, so e.g. spawners and raids still work as they should.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/C2JV3xu.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The type of magnum torch you craft defines what kind of mobs will be prevented from spawning. Only new mobs are prevented from spawning, mobs already in the world will not instantly vanish upon placing a magnum torch!</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Diamond:</strong> All monsters, such as zombies, skeletons, creepers, spiders, phantoms and so on.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Emerald:</strong> Passive mobs such as wandering traders and trader llamas (animals are technically affected, but not really, since they only spawn during world gen or from breeding, which are both unaffected by magnum torches)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Amethyst:</strong> Cave and water mobs, such as bats, all squids, axolotls, and all fish</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Even better: Every kind of magnum torch is fully customizable, including effective range, shape to prevent mob spawns in (cuboid, cylinder, ellipsoid), white-/blacklist for individual mobs, type of blocked mobs (monster/water/cave/passive). So if you want you can completely change what the different types do, e.g. have one type only prevent phantom spawns and another solely deal with wandering traders, while the third one disables all kinds of fish. Its completely up to you!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/C2JV3xu.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/542/2022-03-12_15.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/543/2022-03-13_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Three kinds of magnum torches, all prevent different mob spawns</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Emerald magnum torch in a village</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/544/2022-03-13_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/545/2022-03-13_10.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>The item tooltip tells you all important variables you need to know</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Crafting a diamond magnum torch</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/546/2022-03-13_10.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/547/2022-03-13_10.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Crafting an emerald magnum torch</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Crafting an amethyst magnum torch</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/C2JV3xu.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Forge?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Install my <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod and do it directly in-game!</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Fabric?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Editing configs directly in-game has not yet been implemented. Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor.

This can make a huge difference to frame rates for most computers that are not bottle-necked by the GPU or other components. Even if your GPU can't keep up, you'll experience much more stable frame times thanks to the CPU being able to work on other rendering tasks while it waits.\n- Vertex data for rendered chunks is made much more compact, allowing for video memory and bandwidth requirements to be cut by almost 40%.\nNearby block updates now take advantage of multi-threading, greatly reducing lag spikes caused by chunks needing to be updated.\n- Chunk faces which are not visible (or facing away from the camera) are culled very early in the rendering process, eliminating a ton of geometry that would have to be processed on the GPU only to be immediately discarded. For integrated GPUs, this can greatly reduce memory bandwidth requirements and provide a modest speedup even when GPU-bound.\n- Plentiful optimizations for chunk loading and block rendering, making chunk loading significantly faster and less damaging to frame rates.\n- Many optimizations for vertex building and matrix transformations, speeding up block entity, mob, and item rendering significantly for when you get carried away placing too many chests in one room.\n- Many improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n- Many graphical fixes for smooth lighting effects, making the game run better while still applying a healthy amount of optimization.\n- Smooth lighting for fluids and other special blocks.\n- Smooth biome blending for blocks and fluids, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n  \n</details>","published":"2022-07-02T09:36:53.033379Z","updated":"2023-09-24T21:04:19.380872Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":302655,"followers":339,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["52gcrxOy","suKMGRbi","V7JZgyIU","TnN4CV2Q","c4RHSmo9","WTmxKPaw","ibGbqBbP","w6asrex4","JEoSJNGo","v1Byy3O4","qSw3a67v","ySmWhbfP","QrS8ZpUH","lCbMhmSa","Hlexif59","uqcWRM8W","9DCa1IzX","6YKudvQ5","vkRZleVy","iLEHOlRR","17IcFh9q","KoZMxzwB","YDAuLUY8","bmmEZ4mh","VKligEsm"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4ZqxOvjD/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"9DCa1IzX","project_id":"4ZqxOvjD","author_id":"OGBzw79h","featured":false,"name":"Rubidium mc1.18.2-0.5.6","version_number":"0.5.6","changelog":"### Fixed Chunk rendering with Immersive Engineering (thanks to malte0811)\n\nParity with Forge on rendering block sides (thanks to Su5eD)\n\nFixed crash when disabling fast_biome_colors option (thanks to alcatrazEscapee)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-04-17T11:39:11.294190Z","downloads":28987,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"319544d55243db3955d19a2978c8378f4bc72496208aff31e6c622f63bd100e84caf06f94f6838b27af7768fd2712c721017d9ee76190d2e0349f43a6cb6a22f","sha1":"1ce63fa6642a71b2e1b175bbdc0f61ac12669a67"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4ZqxOvjD/versions/9DCa1IzX/rubidium-0.5.6.jar","filename":"rubidium-0.5.6.jar","primary":true,"size":1342466,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"CsqDoH4a","user":{"id":"OGBzw79h","username":"Asek3","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64613894?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-07-02T09:26:04.535310Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"rubidium-0.5.6.jar.disabled"},"mods\\appleskin-forge-mc1.18.2-2.5.1.jar":{"sha512":"eaf644c8e97ee78441bca9cf05f4b73d025e9a58e5a80c2b64ba9ebf3359d49dfc7d9f569b1d427486115126d8a3aa54f614760ce16852b563b29c6fae6702da","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"EsAfCjCV","slug":"appleskin","project_type":"mod","team":"2RI7njA8","title":"AppleSkin","description":"Food/hunger-related HUD improvements","body":"Adds various food-related HUD improvements.

Engineering","description":"Retrofuturism, industry and multiblocks!","body":"### About\nImmersive Engineering is a tech mod with a certain charm, based on the ideas and concepts, and with most assets created by Damien Hazard.\n\n \n\nOverall, it's about realism-inspired technology:\nInstead of glowing red tubes, it offers actual, hanging powerlines.\nInstead of one block that magically spits out dusts when ore is put in, it offers a crusher, a big multiblock (5x3x3) that features rotating wheels and spits out particles as it breaks the ore.\nInstead of a Laser that turns power into magical light and ores, it offers an Excavator, another massive, resource intensive, multiblock (3x7x8) which digs ores out of the ground with a big rotating bucketwheel.\n\nIE is about making tech mods more balanced and more pretty, and adding its own twist by going for retro-futurism (think BioShock, Order 1886, SkyCaptain and the World of Tomorrow) rather than clinical white+grey future cubes.\n\n\nIt uses the Forge Energy API, known from just about every other tech mod, but it can be played fully standalone. Unlike other mods, IE does not use powertransfer via lanes of blocks, but instead via cables spanned between connectors.\n\nThe mod features Power Generation in forms of waterwheels, windmills, biodiesel and more and many of its machines are multiblocks!\n\nFor all your documentation needs, you should look into this mods ingame documentation, the Engineer's Manual, crafted with a book and a lever.\n\n \n\n### Discord:\n\nCome to [Hazard's Corner](https://discord.com/invite/SnUp97WUrN) to chat about the mod and other projects!\n\n \n\n### Modpack policy:\n\nGo wild, as long as you do not monetize content that doesn't belong to you and abide the EULA and respect our license =)\nAnd obviously, report your bugs on the issue tracker! :D\n\n \n\n### Porting this to another Modloader:\n\nNo, it's not happening. Immersive Engineering is not leaving the Forge API. We're not porting to Fabric, Quilt or whatever other loaders there are.\nThe reasons for this are multiple, but most importantly: This is a hobby and we literally don't have time to learn a new API.","published":"2022-05-29T19:03:19.068401Z","updated":"2023-10-05T10:14:43.275545Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":70408,"followers":176,"categories":["equipment","technology"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["4e5ym3hC","UMcCfBIP","HXdkBiEI","nRta3Aea","AdqQLENe","O9qGVo0Z","fVjq6Z3V","HJrtm24e","d82TaNEn","8cSY80xI","uekfFt7Z","DBzRhQMO","2lg4ADhS","3Ublqy96","g7u3ovfs","fB3ySsyT","OEzUN0pz","jKiL95JQ","7NaNJWwh","ser2bkL3","7Mm7llLR","bHtBdyn4","uqGFpLXw"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tIm2nV03/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"g7u3ovfs","project_id":"tIm2nV03","author_id":"uF0leaD8","featured":false,"name":"1.18.2-8.4.0-161","version_number":"1.18.2-8.4.0-161","changelog":"- Overhaul the Accumulator Backpack (BluSunrize)\n    - Now uses a fancy OBJ model\n    - It's now crafted as an empty frame, to put an accumulator in!\n    - Existing packs will automatically migrate to an LV accumulator.\n    - May be equipped with a shader or banner, to proudly display over your shoulder\n    - The Charging Antenna upgrade will charge the pack by attaching to overhead wires\n    - The Miniaturized Tesla Coil will electrocute your attackers\n    - The Induction Charger will charge your whole inventory\n    - There may be a new secret advancement too ;)\n- Change IEOBJs to be used from the API (Malte)\n- Change recipe display in the manual to allow specifying IDs instead of outputs (Malte)\n- Add a bisexual pride shader (BluSunrize)\n- Add the Rock Softening Acid upgrade for the Mining Drill, giving it Fortune 3!

This is a direct channel to me for feedback & suggestions.\n\n[![discord.gg/3zXwr2atcY](https://i.imgur.com/1FFOXRB.png)](https://discord.gg/3zXwr2atcY)  \n\n[https://discord.gg/3zXwr2atcY](https://discord.gg/3zXwr2atcY \"https://discord.gg/3zXwr2atcY\")\n\n## Features\n\n- A new **mana** system that works similarly to the health bar.\n- Numerous **spells** which can be learned by exploring different **spell trees**.\n- New **potions**, **enchantments** and **effects** to properly embed the new features into vanilla Minecraft.\n- The physical aspect of PvP is still very strong, viable and deadly against magic.\n- The mod is fully **data driven**. This means that you can define **spells** and **spell trees** in **data packs**.\n- Every new feature and mechanic is well thought through to try and not make any vanilla aspect obsolete.\n\n### Addons\n- [Spells & Shields: The Power of Origins](https://modrinth.com/mod/spells-shields-x-origins \"Spells & Shields: The Power of Origins\") (**Origins** integration: Adding origin requirements to spell progression trees.)\n- [Spells & Shields: Magicians' Tinkering](https://modrinth.com/mod/spells-shields-x-tinkers-construct \"Spells & Shields: Magicians' Tinkering\") (**Tinkers' Construct** integration: New mana modifiers for tools, weapons and armor.)\n\n### Compatibility & Integrations\n- Compatible with [Quark](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quark \"Quark\") and [Quark Oddities](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quark-oddities \"Quark Oddities\").\n- Compatible with [Apotheosis](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/apotheosis \"Apotheosis\")\n- Integrated into [Neko's Enchanted Books](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nekos-enchanted-books \"Neko's Enchanted Books\")\n- Integrated into [JEI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei \"JEI\") (Potion recipes, etc.)\n- Integrated into [JEI Enchantment Info](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei-enchantment-info \"JEI Enchantment Info\")\n- Integrated into [Just Enough Effect Descriptions (JEED)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/just-enough-effect-descriptions-jeed \"Just Enough Effect Descriptions (JEED)\")\n\n### Design Plan\n\nThis is the current design plan. This contains a very simple form to suggest spells, if you are interested in contributing:\n\n- [Design Plan & Suggestions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cvfbch-ozy-T2YF1ShYSx_rUriHFPx0boAcgMAAKr_U/edit?usp=sharing \"Design Plan & Suggestions\")\n\nI do not follow this plan 1-to-1 and I do not add every spell suggested but I take a lot of inspiration from these suggestions and they have made a direct impact on this mod.\n\n### Spells\n\nSpells can be equipped in **spell trees** after learning them. You have **5 spell slots** available in total. Each spell slot can be equipped individually with a spell. To fire that spell you use the **key binding** associated with the **radial menu** (default is key `V`) or the key binding associated directly with the slot the spell is in (must be set in your options menu). You can always view your equipped spells in your survival inventory. Spells typically just consume mana as a cost to fire them, but it can differ for each spell.\n\n### Spell Trees\n\nYou gain access to your available spells and spell trees in the **Enchanting Table** (yes, the vanilla one). Similar to enchantments, you unlock spells by consuming experience levels. The cost for each spell can differ. The spells and spell trees you can interact with on an Enchanting Table are **dependent on the amount of bookshelves** placed around it (maximum amount is 32). This means that you can not equip or learn certain spells and spell trees if the surrounding enchanting power (bookshelves) is too low (they will not show up at all).\n  \nSpells are forgotten on death (by default, this is configurable) meaning that you have to re-learn them (eg. invest XP) but they are still visible in their respective spell trees.\n\n### Mana\n\nMana is the source of energy to perform spells. The mana regeneration is always static at **1 full mana unit per 5 seconds** (you can hold up to 10 mana units by default). Of course, your current mana can be influenced by different potions and effects. The mana bar is shown in blue, unless the Leaking effect is applied to you, in which case the colour turns into a slight green. Additionally, there is **extra mana** which is shown in pourple. Extra mana works just like the absorption effect works in terms of health: Whenever you burn mana while having extra mana it is burned from the extra mana resource. Extra mana is given in certain occasions or by certain effects and does not regenerate once burned. There is also a mana boost effect that may affect your maximum mana.\n\n### Effects\n- **Mana Boost**: Works similar to the existing Health Boost effect: Modifies your maximum mana.\n- **Extra Mana**: Works similar to the existing Absorption effect (yellow hearts): Increases your maximum mana with extra units that can not be regenerated.\n- **Silence**: You can not activate any spells actively while this effect is active.\n- **Magic Immune**: You are immune to any magic damage that does not ignore invulnerability (eg. falling out of the world).\n- Some more effects which are available for potion brewing (see Potions below).\n\n### Potions\n\nThere are new potions which interact with your new mana resource. They mirror those potions that interact with your health in time and amplification:\n\n- **Potion of Instant Mana** = **Awkward Potion** + **Lapis Lazuli**: Instantly restores mana, similar to the Potion of Healing.\n- **Potion of Mana Bomb** = **Potion of Instant Mana** + **Fermented Spider Eye**: Instantly burns mana, similar to the Potion of Harming.\n- **Potion of Replenishment** = **Awkward Potion** + **Tube Coral Fan**: Restores mana over time, similar to the Potion of Regeneration.\n- **Potion of Leaking** = **Awkward Potion** + **Dead Tube Coral Fan**: Burns mana over time, similar to the Potion of Poison.\n\n### Enchantments\n\n- **Magic Protection**: Applied to **armour**. Works similar to existing Protection enchantments (eg. Protection, Projectile Projection, ...): Protects twice as well against magic damage as the Protection enchantment does but is incompatible with other Protection enchantments.\n- **Mana Blade**: Works similar to existing damage enchantments (eg. Sharpness, Bane of Arthropods, ...): Consumes mana on hit to increase damage but is incompatible with other damage-increase enchantments.\n- **Mana Shield**: TODO This does nothing as of now. I recommend NOT using this as compatibilities might change.\n- **Mana Regeneration**: Increases your mana regeneration: Wearing a full set of armor with the maximum level of this enchantment applied effectively doubles your mana regeneration. Chestplate and Leggings give more than Helmet and Boots. Incompatible with \"Maximum Mana\".\n- **Maximum Mana**: Increases your maximum mana: Wearing a full set of armor with the maximum level of this enchantment applied effectively doubles your maximum mana. Chestplate and Leggings give more than Helmet and Boots. Incompatible with \"Mana Regeneration\".\n\n### Attributes\n- Maximum Mana: Min Value: 0, Max Value: 1024, Default Value: 20, ID: `spells_and_shields:generic.max_mana`\n- Mana Regeneration: Min Value: 0, Max Value: 50, Default Value: 1, ID: `spells_and_shields:generic.mana_regeneration`\n\n### Commands\n\nThese might change slightly with the full release of v2.\n\n- `/spells progression learn (targets) (spell)`: Makes a target learn a specific spell.\n- `/spells progression learn (targets) all`: Makes a target learn all spells.\n- `/spells progression forget (targets) (spell)`: Makes a target forget a specific spell (a forgotten spell can still be seen in spell trees but must be re-learned).\n- `/spells progression forget (targets) all`: Makes a target forget all spells (a forgotten spell can still be seen in spell trees but must be re-learned).\n- `/spells progression reset (targets)`: Resets spell progression for all targets to start (full wipe).\n- `/spells slots set (targets) (slot) direct (spell)`: Sets a spell in a spell slot (0-4) for all targets.\n- `/spells slots set (targets) (slot) (spell-tree) (spell-id)`: Sets a spell in a spell slot (0-4) for all targets.\n- `/spells slots remove (targets) (slot)`: Clears a spell slot (0-4) for all targets.\n- `/spells slots clear (targets)`: Clears all spell slots for all targets.\n\n## Data Packs\n\nFeatures:\n\n- **Spells** can be fully defined via json files in data packs.\n- **Spells** are automatically synchronized from server to client.\n- **Spell Trees** can be fully defined via json files in data packs.\n- **Spell Trees** do not require synchronization from server to client.

Everything is explained inside said configuration files. Most values can be changed while the game is open.\n\n# YouTube Video\n\n([Click to view](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpeALzr9Lhw \"YouTube Video Link\"))\n\n[![YouTube Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/SpeALzr9Lhw/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpeALzr9Lhw)\n\n## Affiliate Link\n\n[![Minecraft Server Hosting on Kinetic Hosting: Save 15% with Code: SPELLS](https://i.imgur.com/GgmmAJV.png)](https://billing.kinetichosting.net/aff.php?aff=637)\n","published":"2022-12-27T13:12:28.246904Z","updated":"2023-11-21T14:09:45.371147Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":3503,"followers":45,"categories":["adventure","game-mechanics","magic"],"additional_categories":["equipment","library"],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["4emmlnpU","7We6k3dZ","WxoFaEdu","hjxxo1Zv","UI9PFRy5","Aw3I2Cb8","Jhgntim5","leVy8Ezy","bczt8Tx6","YgmztjBK","tWlULqTK","JgIPXOQs","sVxUkmTt","FEqpaGui","63Wisd7u","cUsKOSNx","aPwLXNGa","HJEizmmA","OQrzO2KZ","eUeMUsXM","bXgHd6df","cYWLCfFH","2xKRdlK3","jnpG1wEW","Iu0iFHtL","cJbv88Li","dPhSihNi","D33I0EAM","dfNU7VTK","nRRFJ9x3","nmf9uSr1","Bk4RRon3","NAhFNu0N","jlCS5XQ3","QAsvtgtX","VWrQ4NSc","rSjfFWua","GqSaQhJJ","wP9n0H1x","DhBmEzVP","6vEVOXCl","jvvSdVD7","AH2xblIh","zPnsYjtR","3ERXUOiE","MgaV7GoF","hQ7ZaT7W","7b35GStg","s5uN3n5j","FxMpqD84","nFOmOJaQ","dpiAznZh","cxyXTS04","VNJ5Knxa","BXYEnaS0","pkk7oPtp","G4qLFLaw","IEMItJnK","OcC7zEJJ","3kl9lQed","hcGcBFAZ"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4cfxEMAc/4d57956f44bb0d60784e25d506ef1218e75c8be0.png"},"version":{"id":"OcC7zEJJ","project_id":"4cfxEMAc","author_id":"rgReb4ar","featured":false,"name":"Spells & Shields 1.18.2-2.15.1","version_number":"1.18.2-2.15.1","changelog":"- Mirror 1.20.2-2.15.1 development:\n  - Fix xp requirements: You do not need to have enough xp anymore when learning spells while in creative mode\n  - Minor code fixes","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-21T14:08:14.654558Z","downloads":79,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"6cdb2a9c1a07438ed428f295e35a255e7d499a2a95e6d901db67c8617b6068176cc49c16c77d2da12651b86e9c836f5c18de1460ec69be873dffe19e981abe29","sha1":"5cf4635653fcb565d701b4e5ecd0278cf14b5310"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4cfxEMAc/versions/OcC7zEJJ/spells_and_shields-1.18.2-2.15.1.jar","filename":"spells_and_shields-1.18.2-2.15.1.jar","primary":true,"size":1045244,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"hkk3S4Aq","user":{"id":"rgReb4ar","username":"CAS_ual_TY","name":"CAS_ual_TY","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41904979?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-07-08T12:54:49.954361Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"spells_and_shields-1.18.2-2.15.1.jar"},"mods\\world-host-0.4.8+1.18.2-forge.jar.disabled":{"sha512":"77dc9a29f1bf9fd6d5004178558c49067b9c0ad676e97c5f6068d672bc7e629dd2b36d494d71c1ec0f098a89bec608f917f281e201fdcaca1c693b187bd11319","disabled":true,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"2AIZDfYo","slug":"world-host","project_type":"mod","team":"sZN5zUXE","title":"World Host","description":"Host your singleplayer worlds without having to run a server or setup port forwarding!","body":"# World Host\n\n[![Modrinth](https://img.shields.io/modrinth/dt/world-host?color=00AF5C&label=Downloads&style=round&logo=modrinth)](https://modrinth.com/mod/world-host)\n![Mod Environment](https://img.shields.io/badge/Enviroment-Client-purple?style=round)\n\n[![Server uptime](https://img.shields.io/uptimerobot/ratio/m794216582-8c2e3383b556b643f86c85fe?label=Server%20uptime&color=blue)](https://stats.uptimerobot.com/jL0OztYWBj)\n\nHost your singleplayer worlds **without having to run a server or setup port forwarding!** In the future, we also plan to support Bedrock Edition clients\nthrough the use of Geyser.\n\n## What if my friend doesn't have the mod installed?\n\nIf your friend doesn't have the mod installed, you cannot use the friends system with them. However, you can run the command `/worldhost ip` to get an IP that can be used with tunneling. Do note, however, that not using the friends system could increase ping. If you don't want the ping increase, you can run `/worldhost tempip` to get a *temporary* server IP that lasts for at least 60 seconds. Clients who connect within the 60 seconds will remain connected. If you plan to never use the friends system, you can disable it in the mod settings (requires [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu)).\n\n## How does this mod work?\n\nThis mod has a server that your client connects to, this server is used to communicate with other clients using World Host. \n\n1. When your friend wants to join you, your friend's client asks the server for an IP address to connect to. \n2. The server then asks your client to create a join mode (`JoinType` in the protocol). There are two join mods: UPnP and Proxy. \n3. UPnP mode is tried first. Your client tries to open a temporary port forward in your router that your friends client can use to connect to you directly. \n4. If UPnP succeeds, your client tells the server the port to use, then the server tells your friend's client your IP and the port number. \n5. If UPnP fails, then your client tells the server to use Proxy mode. The server will then give your friend's client the same \"proxy IP\" as `/worldhost ip` does. \n \n`/worldhost tempip` tries to do UPnP first instead of just giving you the proxy IP straightaway.\n\n## License\n\nThe mod is open source and licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\n","published":"2023-03-11T20:51:54.784753Z","updated":"2023-12-07T22:33:32.774927Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":50972,"followers":200,"categories":["social","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.1","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","23w13a_or_b"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["9PfspiV8","Uuir1b0G","EuvqI57t","jJWTbDdE","nR0eIYO4","CdbGYhSm","WkisxqR2","4e3hUMKC","i46D129h","LRLhsafw","sh4CqNhd","2CymuuKb","ViFRrwdZ","aXqsDnNz","6vOXR1YT","xDvqAEXm","c6P0PfyG","nRvw56ql","Euc7yOKr","x5ugOezp","4GmVirvM","B3CnfjUA","NUIuRpVQ","iIMCErfE","J5pUtfdc","PPljYC4r","KtqyJS1W","wilqrT52","RotPCiNK","KXfbclCl","aoetk1Uh","bSuFmgpj","k8iX1Ijv","I4sijzXJ","HtPRZi9i","sGR8txQa","R5cR22aX","CwiC6xyB","jqPoVw7d","o8y1EWs5","A1I3paQo","XujehbCG","cVxM2Xnf","vflDG1Yx","1pktlrPZ","jxwPpUP2","465nqrG1","mqc1lQTD","VFw2sSSu","3pjiG69D","nFYHGcdq","Zk0GR2nj","OgNtDjRg","9YwSbkqc","IcAo1Jur","xIYaYYxh","a58BWCru","TgYiZUvP","oXZabUtf","u2nyzt27","zDm6HAZm","CqmV35Kx","JKfsrBC7","9eguLJnm","3C0JqS5m","t3Ie2usV","GDGYGxHr","19q2clcZ","8VpvizQP","LQEpgDUK","5EhsjGgT","ikL9gzOB","dTlz2nlf","Xas9RjtZ","L3H6KksO","skU9SU3H","8sjzwCja","6X7oUxrk","B2kkYFa8","DrRNz8SW","J9lMfh4k","pHhioS2e","sraiskbx","Dvi3CAxu","YjM3XIfA","xF0NFHfV","ZfjsMVQd","VyFqjHwO","lGoJkIkW","b7DNRw9r","tnsOxALW","gBmxYuUN","pic5u4fL","mLXG2vpH","ducFgDzc","hUkp2dey","lxOtS9Vl","tYljHDq3","fgfcF1O2","jDW6yqFo","ZbaDIPpM","hZOnXG3A","q9RL62WV","dU81iMDq","dWPV8leb","iOxYQeLv","Nttg41Py","z30xjJ6G","1FWH5maM","sHs18iUV","Ld363sM2","b7X8PPlR","a5KEU5wg","b5w9Avyz","rbldxKzV","W9ggWofn","hPE11Pcs","UB7cC7yR","EpJP5uu6","q7HRWFT8","HsC1QUR1","tsQ5qovF","Kud1xkDy","cjLZh8sk","XrghVsKZ","nzuqHx8i","EE9sW6sw","hK8foR8f","UcC1m8Hs","NNHLy1X2","sdGHyyEO","UODyiEgH","Dr5pfXfQ","VOzH70Tz","4XH0dAV0","89zIuajy","yBJyY7dm","mT9JLexq","bJpDfihp","abxdoM4E","7UsmmtZI","eBlQHbx1","ebhhHHQl","EFudVr52","Cn8ZcMUV","JSZr1eSd","LtiFhER1","OJwOywWz","bEq5QCxS","fenawDny","F4FY30yt","QjqIuhRg","jqC01iWh","au9RRwX1","OD2632ha","zKbMiag6","Q2y9phBT","EbP0vEnF","43NLbhUU","ityoeYzp","5SehLv42","sCaJuhIO","Y6idzKd2","ZnbcDZGJ","fUlAYEtQ","Z6sFUrwv","Iha8U2iz","rBB5StnS","thfrZQjP","XteeoDYk","N8ThgPbA","z1PjOHBF","gXuD95df","eg3IU3SQ","Cpew8B2k","MjbUwf6l","lB3iafW4","yupR7k0x","KeMvifkq","1Tw8mKv4"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/2AIZDfYo/90c8330e827a1162c6e5f4996be4795c8e274991.png"},"version":{"id":"XteeoDYk","project_id":"2AIZDfYo","author_id":"QqVinRab","featured":false,"name":"[Forge 1.18.2] World Host 0.4.8","version_number":"0.4.8+1.18.2-forge","changelog":"+ Fix 1.20.4 launch\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-07T22:32:28.004624Z","downloads":18,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"bce00038c6684e1624c7aa516f8c9c1095df6fa7","sha512":"77dc9a29f1bf9fd6d5004178558c49067b9c0ad676e97c5f6068d672bc7e629dd2b36d494d71c1ec0f098a89bec608f917f281e201fdcaca1c693b187bd11319"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/2AIZDfYo/versions/XteeoDYk/world-host-0.4.8%2B1.18.2-forge.jar","filename":"world-host-0.4.8+1.18.2-forge.jar","primary":true,"size":299099,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha1":"50aaecdfd2b6ab0cca9f268275af9bf0be865f6a","sha512":"da3056d9923d90c7899ee66b6af3f0b2c957adb22a95c4f29fc8af4fa8923b70541a34b6f8d6c6c43f02ca9d41705824892aa5bcd8e9fd530e82973f17a41216"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/2AIZDfYo/versions/XteeoDYk/world-host-0.4.8%2B1.18.2-forge-sources.jar","filename":"world-host-0.4.8+1.18.2-forge-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":164683,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"sZN5zUXE","user":{"id":"QqVinRab","username":"Gaming32","name":"Josiah (Gaming32) Glosson","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42721887?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-01-29T17:56:02.207454Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"world-host-0.4.8+1.18.2-forge.jar.disabled"},"mods\\Modern-Elevators-Escalators-forge-1.18.2-3.1.6.jar":{"sha512":"50989c74079955e00992f7262a1c157168c9aee835b7feda015ca5cd46ca406054aaf0d58f3c0742dd42d113e4cf956677cd050a478e9a78d92df3c6ce4f9f33","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"VmZO1Bdj","slug":"modern-elevators-and-escalators","project_type":"mod","team":"s7KPX6Vg","title":"Modern Elevators and Escalators","description":"Fully functional, realistic, and advanced elevators and escalators in Minecraft!","body":"# Please Read!

installed |\n\n## The GUI\n\nYou can open the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key.\nThis allows you to open the settings, group chats, mute yourself, disable the voice chat, start/stop a recording and hide all icons.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TCCHTl8.png)\n\n### Group Chats\n\nGroup chats allow you to talk to players that are not in your vicinity.\nTo open the group chat interface, either press the group button in the voice chat GUI or just press the `G` key.\n\nTo create a new group, just type a name in the text field and press the button next to it.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FihRdNd.png)\n\nCreating or joining a group will bring you into the group chat interface.\nYou will also see the heads of the group members in the top left corner of your screen.\nTalking players will be outlined.\nYou can disable these icons by pressing the third button from the left.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZVSfBms.png)\n\nPlayers that are not in a group will see a group icon next to your head, indicating that they can't talk to you.\n\nYou can invite players to your group chat by entering the command `/voicechat invite <playername>`.\n\n### Settings\n\nYou can access the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key and pressing the settings button.\n\nThis menu offers the ability to change the general voice chat volume and your microphone amplification.\nIn addition, there is the possibility to specify the recording and playback device.\n\nBy clicking the 'Enable microphone testing' button, you can hear your own voice and adjust the activation level of the voice activation.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TMyfSYU.png)\n\n## Important Notes\n\nYou need to open a port on the server. This is port `24454` `UDP` by default.\nWithout opening this port, the voice chat will not work.\nThis port can be changed in the server config.\nMore information [here](https://modrepo.de/minecraft/voicechat/wiki/setup).\n\nThe voice chat is encrypted, but we don't guarantee the security of it. Use at your own

With this mod, items in accessory slots will inherit the dynamic lighting behavior defined by the\ndynamic lighting mod. As an example, if a held torch would provide dynamic lighting, then installing this mod will cause\ntorches placed in accessory slots to also provide dynamic lighting.\n\n**Please note: This mod does NOT add any content or slots on its own.

For example, if using Lucent then this mod is\nclient-side only because Lucent is client-side only.

The viewer can also apply deobfuscation mappings.\n\nIt works by sampling statistical data about the systems activity, and constructing a call graph based on this data. The call graph is then displayed in an online viewer for further analysis by the user.\n\nThere are two different profiler engines:\n* Native `AsyncGetCallTrace` + `perf_events` - uses [async-profiler](https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler) (*only available on Linux x86_64 systems*)\n* Built-in Java `ThreadMXBean` - an improved version of the popular [WarmRoast profiler](https://github.com/sk89q/WarmRoast) by sk89q.\n\n### ⚡ Memory Inspection\n\nspark includes a number of tools which are useful for diagnosing memory issues with a server.\n\n* **Heap Summary** - take & analyse a basic snapshot of the servers memory\n  * A simple view of the JVM's heap, see memory usage and instance counts for each class\n  * Not intended to be a full replacement of proper memory analysis tools. (see below)\n* **Heap Dump** - take a full (HPROF) snapshot of the servers memory\n  * Dumps (& optionally compresses) a full snapshot of JVM's heap.\n  * This snapshot can then be inspected using conventional analysis tools.\n* **GC Monitoring** - monitor garbage collection activity on the server\n  * Allows the user to relate GC activity to game server hangs, and easily see how long they are taking & how much memory is being free'd.\n  * Observe frequency/duration of young/old generation garbage collections to inform which GC tuning flags to use\n\n### ⚡ Server Health Reporting\n\nspark can report a number of metrics summarising the servers overall health.\n\nThese metrics include:\n\n* **TPS** - ticks per second, to a more accurate degree indicated by the /tps command\n* **Tick Durations** - how long each tick is taking (min, max and average)\n* **CPU Usage** - how much of the CPU is being used by the server process, and by the overall system\n* **Memory Usage** - how much memory is being used by the process\n* **Disk Usage** - how much disk space is free/being used by the system\n\nAs well as providing tick rate averages, spark can also **monitor individual ticks** - sending a report whenever a single tick's duration exceeds a certain threshold. This can be used to identify trends and the nature of performance issues, relative to other system or game events.\n\n## Usage\nTo install, just add the **.jar** file to your mods directory.\n\nInformation about [how to use commands](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/Command-Usage) can be found in the docs.\n\nIf you’d like help analysing a profiling report, or just want to chat, feel free to join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/PAGT2fu).\n\n\n## Guides\nThere are a few small \"guides\" available in the docs, covering the following topics.\n* [The tick loop](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/The-tick-loop)\n* [Finding the cause of lag spikes](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/Finding-lag-spikes)","published":"2021-06-04T13:36:54.735179Z","updated":"2023-12-11T22:48:54.192826Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":315339,"followers":675,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["JdNt7oGW","liwd7pvc","D6L5yWtJ","huGeKmwp","sf2nOVoP","DhT8Y7bB","b3zKGLTS","yysWZODg","eEAJpQea","VkKsarbC","qBdtA5uj","6BEDTXhR","9NSIbttL","JjikdHMk","sYlxF6IX","CWiQ0oM4","xvqXC3WU","X9SnVAPS","jg0K11We","Biivc7P1","g60nhl1v","LVujS26K","6hatB19T","FnKxsd40","mMSAkTm6","3opVno4q","EWTsXhFU","RhyaY2vw","XXMFHMBO","OT1CD9Qj","E5XaSI1N","1K3xO8TS","23U6xkbl","g5rM8xSA","pjW9S4dI","N7JzEApO","1dlOe6ez","XhFbpH8f","VhY9p1RU","GygIHGfW","qyMNf4Pn","oCK984FP","dVHkMOHv","Yp6s4wsw","BeIg1bik","4FXHDE9F","XGW2fviP","h0Z2ObM0","tCU9VuzX","8ZQqfeXy","3FEq2lT7","FeV5OquF"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/l6YH9Als/13676ddae142a85998c1c0086cafc30ce2efde80.png"},"version":{"id":"GygIHGfW","project_id":"l6YH9Als","author_id":"iRtG8gdL","featured":true,"name":"1.10.38 (Forge 1.18.2)","version_number":"1.10.38-forge","changelog":"This is a backported version of spark v1.10.x for Minecraft 1.18.2.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-04-24T16:51:16.694708Z","downloads":3073,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"dab92b9e409cd9c4d6e55e8eb7476d0109f3857e6207d0b9e519730234992d6e7d60e10e3f06127cdb59f5135120e26765d1fd416885e60ae14f1281b2327346","sha1":"67e95b23b539ba28f82037eca2308e8ed0e32b03"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/l6YH9Als/versions/GygIHGfW/spark-1.10.38-forge.jar","filename":"spark-1.10.38-forge.jar","primary":true,"size":2976453,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"xI8OXSR4","user":{"id":"iRtG8gdL","username":"lucko","name":"lucko","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8352868?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-05T13:08:25.863305Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"spark-1.10.38-forge.jar"},"mods\\ctov-2.9.4.jar":{"sha512":"eba4881c63ccdac9c99a89acea24322006c59491a1eb996b2f6dbc2982be7a6da1c6450b1524b80ed59f425da2c302a1d9f43bb0085fb510a3ee338cb1113c9a","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"fgmhI8kH","slug":"ct-overhaul-village","project_type":"mod","team":"Zs08w8wX","title":"ChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Village","description":"Enhances and creates new villages and pillager outposts, that perfectly fit into your Minecraft world.","body":"**![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_HEADER.webp)**\n**![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_BANNER1.webp)**\n\n**ChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Village (CTOV) is a mod that adds new and improved villages and pillager outposts to Minecraft.** It is available for both Forge and Fabric, and it works with most world-generation and structure mods. CTOV adds 23 village variants and 14 pillager outpost variants, each of which is tailored to the terrain, theme, and biome of your Minecraft world.\n\nCTOV will not be backported beyond 1.18.2 for the mod version and 1.17 for the datapack version. This means that if you are playing an older version of Minecraft, you will not be able to use CTOV.\n\n<details><summary>FAQs</summary>\n\n1.  **Is it safe to update CTOV to a newer version?**\nYes, it is safe to update CTOV to a newer version. However, if you do experience any problems, please let the mod author know so that they can fix them.\n\n2.  **Is it safe to add CTOV to an already existing world?**\nYes, it is safe to add CTOV to an already existing world. However, the new structures will only spawn in newly generated chunks.\n\n3.  **Is this mod for Forge or Fabric/Quilt?**\nCTOV is available for all three mod loaders: Forge, Fabric, and Quilt.\n\n4.  **How can I locate the new structures?**\nTo locate the new structures, you can use the `/locate` command.\n    For 1.18.2, you would use the following command:\n    >  /locate ctov:\\[structure\\_from\\_list\\] <br>\n\n    For 1.19+, you would use the following command:\n    >  /locate structure ctov:[structure_from_list] <br>\n\n    The `[structure_from_list]` part of the command is the name of the structure that you want to locate. You can find a list of all the available structures in the CTOV documentation.\n\n5.  **Does CTOV modify existing vanilla structures?**\nThe only structures that are modified by CTOV are vanilla villages in older versions. In newer versions, CTOV creates its own structures that are separate from vanilla villages.\n\n6.  **What about the loot of these structures?**\nThe vast majority of structures use vanilla loot tables for better mod compatibility. However, they also use some custom loot tables to integrate said structures into the world better. You will still find pillager outpost loot in pillager outposts, profession chests in villages, as well as bells, workstations, etc., but you may also find new stuff like food, armour, and other goodies.\n\n7.  **How can I report bugs/issues/suggestions?**\nTo report bugs, issues, or suggestions, please go to the CTOV GitHub repo and create an issue. You can also message the mod author on Discord.\n\n8.  **Can I include CTOV in my modpack?**\nYes, you can include CTOV in your modpack. However, please be sure to give credit to the mod author and provide a link to their page.\n\n9.  **Can I have CTOV for 1.x.x, please?**\nIf it's lower than 1.18.2, no. Please don't ask this question. The technical limit is too high here.\n\n10.  **Can I give Choicetheorem any commission or support?**\nThe mod author does not accept commissions or monetary support. They are doing this as a hobby and do not want to be paid for their work.\n\nI hope this answers all of your questions.\n</details>\n\n**![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_BANNER4.webp)**\n\n\n**ChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Village (CTOV) is compatible with most world-generation and structure mods.** It also works with Guard Villager and other structure packs by ChoiceTheorem. Mods that add new villagers will need compatibility packs.\n\nHere are some more details about the compatibility of CTOV with other mods:\n\n-   **World-generation mods:** CTOV relies on vanilla biome Tags, so almost all world-generation mods like Terralith, Oh Biome You'll Go, and Biomes O'plenty will have appropriate CTOV villages in their biomes.\n-   **Structure mods:** Various structure mods like Town&Tower and Repurposed structures also work well with CTOV. However, it is important to exercise caution when using too many mods, as this can cause instability. The same applies to Better Village.\n-   **Other mods:** Any other mod that doesn't affect villages and villagers will be compatible by default. Mods that add new villagers will need compatibility packs, which can be found on the Modrinth website.\n\n<details><summary>Mod integration</summary>\n\n-   [✓] **Waystone and Bountiful are compatible as is for latest versions of CTOV.**\n-   [✓] [**Farmer's delight**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-farmers-delight-compat)\n-   [✓] [**More villagers**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-more-villagers-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Croptopia**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-croptopia-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Friend and Foe**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-friends-and-foes-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Immersive Engineering**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-immersive-engineering-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Incubation**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-incubation-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Chef's delight**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-chefs-delight-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Beautify**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-beautify-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Vampirism**](https://modrinth.com/mod/vampirism-integrations)\n-   [✓] [**Domestication Innovation**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-domesticated-innovation-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Wizards**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-wizards-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Villager Plus**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-villagers-plus-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Advance peripheral**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-advanced-peripheral-compat)\n-   [✓] [**BYG**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-byg-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Savage and Ravage**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-savage-and-ravage-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Vending Machine**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-vending-machine-compat)\n-   [✓] [**All bark All bite**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-abab-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Gazebos**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-gazebo-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Paladins & Priests**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-paladins-n-priests-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Paragliders**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-paragliders-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Pneumatic craft**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-pneumaticcraft-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Jelly Fishing**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-jellyfishing-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Iron's Spells 'n Spellbooks**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-irons-spells-n-spellbooks-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Monobank**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-monobank-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Wares**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-wares-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Etches**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-etched-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Floralis**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-floralis-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Rats**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-rats-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Create structures**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-create-structures)\n-   [ ] Questager -

[Website.](https://tr7zw.github.io/project/entityculling/)\n\nMinecraft skips rendering things that are behind you, so why is it rendering everything that you still can't see because of a wall in the way? This mod utilizes your other CPU cores/threads to do really quick path-tracing from your camera to all block/-entities to determine rather they are visible or not. During the rendering, the not visible ones will be skipped the same way entities behind you are.\n\n[![Shockbyte](https://tr7zw.dev/img/shockbyte_black.png?v=2)](https://shockbyte.com/partner/tr7zw)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- none\n\n## Incompatible\n\n- none (With some mods you might need to add the blocks to the config whitelist to fix visual issues)\n\n## Tested with\n\n- Sodium\n- Iris\n- Optifine\n \n## Note to why it works even with Sodium/Optifine\n\nThis has been tested with other mods, Optifine(Optifabric), Iris, and Sodium, in all cases resulting in fps gains in places like Game Server lobbies.\n\nYou might wonder why it does increase the FPS with Sodium since Sodium has \"Use Entity Culling\" in its Advanced settings and enabled by default. The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.","published":"2022-05-25T10:09:09.784330Z","updated":"2023-12-11T21:15:39.285813Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2636134,"followers":3735,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.8.8","1.8.9"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WiIRU3UP","AXYavMt5","Qek7k92S","2WBkUuat","2mzFyULh","mlP64Wt9","4GD4dwQK","LQ3vI7aU","WdlVJYKE","R0KPBo5r","1Vc3QD0W","b2cBCjB4","bRBO9ZzX","Wq0up4B4","bE2TQ25z","reIgRPky","N7HJbtfe","AdkBUIRs","WR6z6MYC","twdGLDHv","jFORrKV6","d3CbGntl","UvJN5Cy4","NB6TPjI8","374z4jcq","d20sUcYn","17Hi340V","BDwHAdWc","1MBmcSf1","LwvhfrTE","tUVHg6HN","pVb6ajsR","DkksI437","KSu61vcB","Ek0VIX9q","mBYyh1qv","HSirwtwV"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"jFORrKV6","project_id":"NNAgCjsB","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":true,"name":"1.6.1-1.18.2 - Forge","version_number":"1.6.1-1.18.2","changelog":"## What's Changed\r\n* Reworked the ray engine to fix corner cases.

As a result, they have closed the performance gap, obsoleting Starlight on the client side.\n\nCompatibility\n------------------\nStarlight can be installed either on the dedicated server or client. It is _not_ required to be installed on both sides.\nIf you have Starlight on the server, clients can use Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight to connect. Likewise, if you have Starlight on \nthe client, you can connect to Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight servers.\n\nStarlight cannot be installed _with_ Phosphor, they are completely incompatible. \nBrowsing through [Starlight's Issue Tracker](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/issues \"Starlight's Issue Tracker\") will show\nfurther mod incompatibilities. Starlight is a rather destructive light engine rewrite, so it should be \nexpected to break mods more often.\n\nPurpose\n------------------\nStarlight was developed for higher scale dedicated servers, as they suffered performance problems due to how ungodly slow the\nlight engine was. The only solution was to create an extremely invasive mod which rewrote the entire light engine.\nI ported the mod to fabric so that I can update it during snapshots, and decided that publishing it for \nall users, especially client users, would be beneficial. However, it does have the downside of being an invasive mod:\nBeing invasive didn't affect higher scale servers because they run on Bukkit.\n\nFurther reading on the technical details of how Starlight achieves its performance \ncan be read here: [TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/blob/fabric/TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md \"TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md\")\n\nPerformance for 1.20:\n------------------\nHere are a few graphs showing performance in 2 areas on: Block editing at high y-levels, and normal block light updates:\n\n~~Light engine time chunk generation Graph~~ has been removed as a benchmark as it is invalid for 1.20. Starlight and Vanilla are close enough on 1.20 that\nthis test is also useless.\n![Block update at height graph](https://i.imgur.com/ZQx7Ek0.png \"Block update at height graph\")\n![Simple glowstone block update](https://i.imgur.com/MrA2PQk.png \"Simple glowstone block update\")\n\nPerformance for 1.19.4 and below:\n------------------\nHere are a few graphs showing performance in 3 critical areas: Chunk generation, Block editing at high y-levels, and normal block light updates:\n\n![Light engine time chunk generation Graph](https://i.imgur.com/5aI8Eaf.png \"Light engine time chunk generation Graph\")\n![Block update at height graph](https://i.imgur.com/kKtbe9y.png \"Block update at height graph\")\n![Simple glowstone block update](https://i.imgur.com/yCNK602.png \"Simple glowstone block update\")","published":"2021-09-12T18:30:52.613317Z","updated":"2023-10-27T08:19:49.826880Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":111524,"followers":164,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17.1","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["RcAkwRce","QDfK5kGC","6n1Cz7ld","5aMZMK7v","eUgPCLKt","cNa0vkNj","SPQfFKXA"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com//data/iRfIGC1s/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"5aMZMK7v","project_id":"iRfIGC1s","author_id":"fYyU5YhM","featured":false,"name":"Starlight 1.0.2 1.18.2 (Forge) ","version_number":"1.0.2+1.18.2","changelog":"Requires forge 40.0.0+; not compatible with 1.18.1","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-03-20T21:25:09.642621Z","downloads":20361,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"942c0d1f0f0d0bc492eadd7e8347891e30d633ca86b3dfd2e9d59ea0deee03614e6a66e5a66eeab00564b12a05c40cbd6cbac335a07bc971c97b7149b0406a38","sha1":"c7dde83f5fbc864d85842c74a4433a8a5c0f15b7"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/iRfIGC1s/versions/1.0.2%2B1.18.2/starlight-1.0.2%2Bforge.546ae87.jar","filename":"starlight-1.0.2+forge.546ae87.jar","primary":true,"size":110596,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"st6zzqkJ","user":{"id":"fYyU5YhM","username":"spottedleaf","name":"Spottedleaf","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6100722?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-08-29T13:50:25.716250Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"starlight-1.0.2+forge.546ae87.jar.disabled"},"mods\\ironchests-2.0.5-forge.jar":{"sha512":"20ede0c6bbeaadbd509b25331acb32c6e661227f388674ddef053e28860318de044c7a7c15203796ad3023a2ee71da6660066d1cfc6748c66e9c6428ae456a4c","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"n2de3t2z","slug":"ironchests","project_type":"mod","team":"eLachKF6","title":"Iron Chests: Restocked","description":"Iron Chests: Restocked provide multiple variants of chests that increase in size and have different properties.","body":"<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/smvZIhc.png\"/>\n\n<center>General Info, Iron chests Restocked is a 1.17+ mod that provides a variety of chests with different properties and sizes!

I recommend removing\nOculus if you do not need shaders.\n\n## Credits\n\n* JellySquid & the CaffeineMC team, for making Sodium in the first place, without which this project would not be possible\n* Asek3, for the initial port to Forge\n* XFactHD, for providing a list of gamebreaking Rubidium issues to start this work off, and for testing early builds\n* Pepper, for their invaluable assistance with getting Forge lighting to work on Sodium 0.5\n* CelestialAbyss and input-Here for making the new logo design\n\n## License\n\nPlease refer to the [LICENSE](https://github.com/embeddedt/embeddium/blob/16.x/forge/LICENSE) file.

In that sense, it is an automatic _Cutting Board_.  \nIn order to use it, the correct tool has to be placed into the machine, using `Right-Click`.\nBy default, only knives and axes are allowed, but this behaviour can be overwritten by modifying the `sliceanddice:allowed_tools` item tag.\nAn example datapack which adds shears to this tag can be found [here](https://github.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/raw/1.20.x/example_datapack.zip)\n\n### Automatic Cooking\n\nAll recipes from Farmer's delight requiring the Cooking Pot are added as heated mixing recipes.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/1.20.x/screenshots/cooking.png)\n\n### Sprinkler\n\nThe Sprinkler is a block which, when provided with a fluid using a pipe, will distribute it in a small area below.  \nDifferent fluids can have different effects.\n\n- Lava applies a small amount of fire damage to entities below\n- Water makes the area below wet, making the world think it's raining there.\n- Potions apply their affect for a short duration to entities below\n- Liquid Fertilizer, a new fluid, applies a bonemeal affect to blocks.\n\nThe latter is meant to enable growing of _Banana Fonds_ from [Neapolitan][NEAPOLITAN] without being dependent on the weather, but it could possibly have other effects on other mods too.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/1.20.x/screenshots/sprinkler.png)\n\n### Overweight Farming\n\nIf present, some compatibility features for [Overweight Farming][OVERWEIGHT_FARMING] is added.  \nThis includes waxing recipes using the deployer,\nas well as showing the axe-stripping of overweight crops in JEI.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/1.20.x/screenshots/strip.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/1.20.x/screenshots/wax.png)\n","published":"2022-08-14T17:09:40.957018Z","updated":"2023-09-22T07:59:41.249837Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":104847,"followers":225,"categories":["food","technology"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["UJTc0pk2","1wP6CNfI","Nk2dO6Go","KriL1JFW","r4yDHtFN","tA385l8n","JH33REuT","tZZRCOac","lXNFlrvW","OIhe0uO4","ZmhTpjLR","pRwBOCJc","gCGCFJis","hPDyRNw3","lrslRK8c","fGG0Gjcv","mG1fIOia","akAH2F1g","89gCgL8n","FF8UA0pu","LfIs9gRN","PmCarZvQ","BZLiJ13y","O8bSqUaV","sGqyWl93","U9GIWHMX","uv6f7FCw","t8iOd0XR","7HTroPJk","kvrLbSxC","1aTrUinS","qWFV16cD","3wyhfJQQ","vd7c2RPJ","mTr2nUPj","t3lFXxzY","aRK21L9m","qaNqtys9","nkNOsYBR","rYnuEPwn","tAgVGTaW","s9l4uqVE","IlpHtI0z","ZEitGVtL","73nfCddX","etRuKHcg","yZ9zZESN","giM4WleV"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/GmjmRQ0A/9af7f38727e4c1dc30c67fefd80b15000a2b8c07.png"},"version":{"id":"ZEitGVtL","project_id":"GmjmRQ0A","author_id":"qxswSLtS","featured":false,"name":"Forge

Its features are tailored to be functional, aesthetically viable, and complementary to preexisting content and provide many new ways to enhance your Vanilla+ experience.\n> The mod requires Moonlight Library<br>\n> While supported, Fabric version might be missing some minor features as the mod is mainly for Forge<br>\n> You are free to include this mod in your modpack\n\nTranslated in the following languages!\nDeutsch | Polski | Fran&ccedil;ais | Русский | Italiano | English | Če&scaron;tina | 한국어 | Українська | Portugu&ecirc;s | Српски | Espa&ntilde;ol | Қазақ | Bahasa Melayu | Pirate Speech | 简体中文 (中国) | 繁體中文 (香港) | 繁體中文 (台灣) | T&uuml;rk&ccedil;e</span></p>\n\n<center>\n<h2> 🖼️ Media 🖼️ </h2>\n</center>\nCheck out some reviews here\n<br>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/avG7OTcsJA0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vHQSjNacrm4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<center>\n<h2>❓ F. A. Q. ❓</h2>\n</center>\n\nQ: How do I disable/tweak X feature?\nA: Refer to the Customization section in the [Wiki](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/Supplementaries/wiki) or join our [Discord]()\n\nQ: Could you update/downgrade to X version?\nA: I plan to eventually port the mod to every new major Minecraft version so be patient.\nAs for downgrades absolutely no, I'm not interested in supporting older obsolete versions. Maintaining this one version already takes up so much of my time and so much changed between those versions that I would have to pretty much re-learn how to mod.\n\nQ: Could you add X feature/block?\nA: I would encourage you to join our Discord. We have a section dedicated to suggestions like that. If I'll feel like your idea fits well enough it will have a high chance to be eventually added.\n\nQ: How do I use X block/item?\nA: Once again refer to the Wiki.\n\nQ: How can I fix this issue/ crash?\nA: Please open a report in the Issues section always including a Crash Report.\n\nQ: Fabric version is missing X\nA: Supplementaries is a mainly a Forge Mod and if some feature is missing that means that it didnt have a simple or easy implementation as Fabric was missing a counterpart of something provided by Forge API that such feature was heavily reliant on.

Some people even went as far as capturing a cow in a jar to provide them with infinite milk!\n\n## Features\n\n- Recipe book to show all food items you can craft or smelt with the things you have in your inventory\n- Upgraded recipe book that can also craft the food items with the things from your inventory\n- Multiblock Kitchens consisting of several components that each unlock new abilities\n- \\#NoFilter book to simply show all food item recipes (no matter what ingredients you have available)\n- Sorting options to see the most nutritious foods you can make\n- Supports Pam's Harvestcraft as well as many other food mods\n\n![](https://blay09.net/files/brand/cookingforblockheads_2.png)","published":"2022-06-15T18:26:10.346960Z","updated":"2023-12-09T12:50:53.288690Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":49036,"followers":101,"categories":["decoration","food","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["30Rf3OVG","VFJwjAIW","8WX88qqx","iWt5AcjY","Khs1RODv","SgIn71z9","TTZwBoRA","JiHDEdps","bgt2G9PN","DPmGOBiL","aeMzou3d","pqYM9QT2","ZmXrw4a2","fG6XdPS6","EIIPTr8R","MHud94uQ","U79DOgDm","IDDuWBtK","XPhxXLsP","vgf8osnr","VGkprttw","HL3wdUKC","x3nr3NXZ","CAkRaaRE","UjospnIq","9JhYGdOq","DmfJQvze","xCmfDNeV","Hs9lqPNL","CDGeZUsi","TqIZXjFt","ZDOSMTDm","sA17ATuT","ZvaAnN5y","3UE5RAKk","yKz0conr","eLbE6TGp","ZkNNxO0n","xMZxxx92","tj2r8UFF","312KYNZr","xSz0Wig5","p7nhHIVG","YJ4WsFrH"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/vJnhuDde/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"XPhxXLsP","project_id":"vJnhuDde","author_id":"WE4nCeiO","featured":false,"name":"12.2.0+forge-1.18.2","version_number":"12.2.0+forge-1.18.2","changelog":"- Added IngredientPredicateWithCache to API to allow for more efficient lookups in cases where the potentially passing ItemStacks can already be limited to a known set of stacks","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-11-03T23:21:00.476918Z","downloads":7847,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"a05f0b1d035b3715a7d75a62a907234ef6d3464e","sha512":"8fe5ee9ea846f6e9679b8e8fccb2c6c0480fb3fcbd986cb398babdeecf6ea76f6bae5c4fd2dc43799772b8eff188742010e6e63b0c6a95632b897b4ca1b0c556"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/vJnhuDde/versions/XPhxXLsP/cookingforblockheads-forge-1.18.2-12.2.0.jar","filename":"cookingforblockheads-forge-1.18.2-12.2.0.jar","primary":true,"size":683519,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"RAATKbAN","project_id":"MBAkmtvl","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"DtzWwJFD","user":{"id":"WE4nCeiO","username":"BlayTheNinth","name":"BlayTheNinth","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1933180?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-02-28T14:04:06.205061Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"cookingforblockheads-forge-1.18.2-12.2.0.jar"},"mods\\davespotioneering-1.18.2-1.3.1.jar":{"sha512":"4d09589aa5affa765fa167ff081ff19d9375ebb55065be9543f57f57730ee200061c8fcc5b40af4393308e5f4a595b278cc6782241b13bd798f23a072dd103b3","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"TaH1eXdZ","slug":"daves-potioneering","project_type":"mod","team":"28U4EJ4z","title":"Dave's Potioneering","description":"Dave’s Potioneering is a mod that makes changes to how potions and alchemy work with the goal of making the brewing and use of potions much more enjoyable.","body":"<center>\n\n![Dave's Potioneering Full Logo](https://trello.com/1/cards/6175a9ee6f432a83e1ef6499/attachments/6175d949f30bd52ea88337b8/previews/6175d94af30bd52ea883385b/download/Daves_Potioneering_2.png)\n![Seperator](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/903714979734229083/999144183619145778/spacer_2_2x.png)\n\n## 📖 About 📖\n\n**Dave’s Potioneering** is a mod that makes changes to how potions and alchemy work with the goal of making **the brewing and use of potions** much more enjoyable. Rather than simply adding more potions to the game, we make changes to the brewing system and inventory management to make the creation of potions more efficient and their application much more intuitive. This is an overall improvement on the current utilization of potions and brewing in Minecraft, and a great Vanilla+ base that compliments other potion-related mods you may be using.\n\n</center>\n\n\n **Dave's Potioneering requires [Geckolib](https://modrinth.com/mod/geckolib).**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Features\n- Potions now stack\n- Splash potions throw much further\n- More efficient brewing\n- Coated weapons\n- Milk bottles\n- New potion-based weapon\n- Support for other mods’ potions\n \n&nbsp;\n\n<center>\n\n## 📘 Wiki/Documentation 📘\n\nPotioneering is a mod that applies numerous changes that you may or may not experience throughout the Minecraft world.

They are not simply pests and menaces, but the main cause of the loss of many lives. Only a brave few can slay a dragon. Even less can tame one.**\n\n**Welcome, to Ice and Fire.**\n\nIce and Fire is a mod created by both Raptorfarian and Alexthe666, which hopes to add dragons in a proper way. Currently, Dragons have two types: Ice and Fire. Fire Dragons breathe fire and roam most of the habitable world, whilst Ice Dragons inhabit the coldest places known to man and freeze their prey to death. Both kinds of dragons spawn naturally as adults. And news has reached us of a new discovery: Lightning dragons, powerful nocturnal creatures that deal blasting bolts of lighting to kill their prey.\n\n \n\nIn 1.2.0, Hippogryphs, Gorgons, and Pixies have been added.\n\nIn 1.3.0, Dragons were redone and Cyclopes have been added.\n\nIn 1.4.0, Sirens, Hippocampi, and Death worms have been added.\n\nIn 1.5.0, Cockatrices, Stymphalian Birds, and Trolls have been added.\n\nIn 1.6.0, Myrmex have been added.\n\nIn 1.7.0, Amphitheres and Sea Serpents have been added.\n\nIn 1.8.0, Dragons were redone and support was added for many other mods.\n\nIn 1.9.0, Dread Liches and Hydras have been added.\n\nIn 2.0.0, Lightning dragons have been added.\n\nIn 2.1.0, Ghosts have been added.\n\n\nWe plan on including additional mythical creatures. For further details check out our [discord](https://discord.gg/DAzxNagMHA) (for more up to date previews)\n\n\nIce and Fire aims to bring to you a revolutionary dragon experience.\nWe allow role players and mod pack makers to have access to all\nthe basic and advanced needs of a dragon hunter and tamer role. These\ninclude:\n\nDragon skeletons - these can be found in desert biomes and can be used to collect a few bones\n\nDragon roosts and caverns - where you can fight dragons and find grand treasures\n\nDragon eggs - which can be found in dragon caves\n\nDragon taming and riding - mount up your tamed dragons and even armour them\n\nDragon equipment - craft tools and weapons from dragon bones and armours from dragon scales\n\nBestiary - for collecting and learning information with regards to dragons\nIn additional updates we will invest time in other mythical monsters and creatures.\n\n\nIce and Fire also provides custom support for the following other mods:\n\n- Just Enough Items (JEI)\n- TheOneProbe\n- HWYLA\n- Thaumcraft\n- CraftTweaker(see the documentation here)\n- Tinker's Construct\n","published":"2023-11-04T19:46:13.838209Z","updated":"2023-11-04T19:57:40.216552Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":7442,"followers":75,"categories":["adventure","magic","mobs"],"additional_categories":["equipment","worldgen"],"game_versions":["1.10.2","1.11.2","1.12.2","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["VxyE62t8","jahXVl7B","737XMmok","lqOUIWIA","hk9Ds2Ek","exnVQUJF","kLgo7C5F"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LVnvHVBp/7f4900581f5f2e1108829fa45e54331eb91dace1.png"},"version":{"id":"kLgo7C5F","project_id":"LVnvHVBp","author_id":"iBpwljlP","featured":false,"name":"Ice and Fire 2.1.12","version_number":"2.1.12-1.18.2","changelog":"-Release for 1.18.2","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-04T19:57:43.616772Z","downloads":3102,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"67ff486e0dcce19afa49f373d7502181035bac65","sha512":"a381e1e6c8c3e4338d8a7f7e05681f02825b4141db966678e6435daa330314726861b6375c36abff088a671f7894f39f21a3f5e80ae9618f2a343c3d43d1f742"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LVnvHVBp/versions/kLgo7C5F/iceandfire-2.1.12-1.18.2.jar","filename":"iceandfire-2.1.12-1.18.2.jar","primary":true,"size":21527416,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"jJfV67b1","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"DFgMc5Zf","user":{"id":"iBpwljlP","username":"AlexModGuy","name":"AlexModGuy","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/iBpwljlP/921ad78a793efff6d03b582fa3dc1f06bb237426.jpeg","bio":"aka Alex Mobiles, Alexander Caverns, Alexthe668\n\nhttps://github.com/AlexModGuy","created":"2023-11-03T16:23:16.718366Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"DFgMc5Zf","user":{"id":"6wxQvqVD","username":"TheBv","name":"Patrick Schrottenbacher","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/6wxQvqVD/5346030452fea3d12e03ae73a79205acb460ee81.png","bio":null,"created":"2023-11-07T01:44:36.837472Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Contributor","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"iceandfire-2.1.12-1.18.2.jar"},"mods\\AlwaysEat-5.1.jar":{"sha512":"5a0ba0f41936b0ceda1c9074d4121cb9c0adfdedecc36d14de215668d91352490bcf53f87f9d7de2f26a734c2c8f19af084ef061600453f758fcaff3570f342b","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"AlwaysEat","description":"Makes all food eatable even when you are full\n","authors":["suppergerrie2"],"version":"${file.jarVersion}","icon":null,"project_type":"mod"},"file_name":"AlwaysEat-5.1.jar"},"mods\\balm-3.2.6.jar":{"sha512":"9a55d477452cebb10eaf3e9c4cd711b0fc6b361e60513c2475992e279189de68b9a660d69d047a0d80d21469ecb01d7b4fe85b494b396a23ea19db72f2eb8d13","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"MBAkmtvl","slug":"balm","project_type":"mod","team":"c1tw4qzj","title":"Balm","description":"Abstraction Layer (but not really)™ for Blay's multiplatform mods","body":"<p><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.patreon.com/blay09\"> <img src=\"https://blay09.net/files/brand/patreon.png\" alt=\"Become a Patron\" width=\"217\" height=\"51\" /> </a> <img src=\"https://blay09.net/files/brand/spacer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"21\" height=\"51\" /> <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://twitter.com/BlayTheNinth\"> <img src=\"https://blay09.net/files/brand/twitter.png\" alt=\"Follow me on Twitter\" width=\"51\" height=\"51\" /> </a> <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://discord.gg/VAfZ2Nau6j\"> <img src=\"https://blay09.net/files/brand/discord.png\" alt=\"Join our Discord\" width=\"51\" height=\"51\" /> </a> <img src=\"https://blay09.net/files/brand/spacer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"20\" height=\"51\" /> </p>\n\n## What is this?\n\nAbstraction Layer (but not really)™ for Blay's multiplatform mods. This is a library mod, it does not add anything on its own.\n\nI do not recommend other modders to build on this as I will ruthlessly break backwards-compatibility as needed for my mods.\n\nNote that this is not a magic solution for running Forge and Fabric mods together, it's only a library my mods will depend on to make publishing for both versions easier.\n\n## Why is this?\n\nI can't just switch to Fabric and abandon all existing Forge users, but I also don't want to miss a Fabric train if there is one.\n\nTrying a port for fun showed that most of the platform-specific things can easily be hidden away from the actual mod code which doesn't have to care about modloader backends, which should hopefully make it much easier to support both mods at the same time.\n\nThere's other libraries that do the same thing, but given the amount of mods I maintain I don't want to put all my money on one boat only to deal with headaches once those other mods stop being supported.\n\n## How does this?\n\nIt just wraps all platform-specific code behind a unified API (in the simplest way possible, there is no magic involved) and provides superclasses to use in cases where platform-specific methods are added to Vanilla classes.\n\nIt also adds a simple network system (similar to Forge's) and a config layer with sync support.\n\n## Who is this?\n\nHi, I'm Blay and my Twitter is at [@BlayTheNinth](https://twitter.com/BlayTheNinth).","published":"2022-06-14T18:11:16.556742Z","updated":"2023-12-09T16:54:58.175585Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":602809,"followers":469,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["yIf5KdB1","C0Q1coDV","OxgGZ2zM","DIjNWWDQ","3FaeA4B3","pLCLIILr","KHoU8dQ1","U6WiexwY","KGco8pn9","3gG05xht","yCm0MvD8","bv4c7vz6","HaskpkVN","rLFLPShY","vtPaYjej","jLBnf4l1","i5Q1d7Pr","TQMftlzA","ZI4feWbU","SLR7Xv0p","AhzvhBQj","oqGuqpwK","DENsCzBf","nErKcTp9","xAQtenTo","1pxcbuZv","840UhUoL","9XoBRgjV","6X6csbpx","nFs2ZvOR","NhlpDRNn","zq3nXKQW","TbFmWuAA","O2nbMbp5","C60k8eYK","XYqAzGqP","XNus763a","qUWyGBdD","RAATKbAN","uATqqu4e","lRKNKP0w","ONL5pq9r","FDkt1ohj","o7IqP6Td","DAOUt1Jg","VYTPVkW0","RXK9iX99","wiayzjLV","rbUpGzGA","i8CwYuCi","I5betUED","NRF4uKO7","c1GjX2k1","Zq0Ko2UQ","d7a0S3hj","l551HLmO","BLkvfQ2x","CO57SmJl","ffUlrjOr","jdk8u9nq","x70MCuv3","sBs7NeXN","BJ0Uk3Di","fFosgnEu","qHXzOzUv","YL5MVHnr","N4NxIVYC","jPAtAJcJ","RYxPLFUw","NMOJStju","qIAY6mKt","JUrMdJP1","VIE9sG8O"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/MBAkmtvl/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"RAATKbAN","project_id":"MBAkmtvl","author_id":"WE4nCeiO","featured":false,"name":"3.2.6+forge-1.18.2","version_number":"3.2.6+forge-1.18.2","changelog":"- Fixed UseBlock and UseItem events on Fabric not respecting cancellation, causing an issue in Hardcore Revival\n- Fixed loot table modifiers preventing other mods from modifying loot tables dynamically","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-03-17T18:00:16.979969Z","downloads":11427,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"9a55d477452cebb10eaf3e9c4cd711b0fc6b361e60513c2475992e279189de68b9a660d69d047a0d80d21469ecb01d7b4fe85b494b396a23ea19db72f2eb8d13","sha1":"e503e90e41279afddec03d196073f7f7eabd0735"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/MBAkmtvl/versions/RAATKbAN/balm-3.2.6.jar","filename":"balm-3.2.6.jar","primary":true,"size":622514,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"c1tw4qzj","user":{"id":"WE4nCeiO","username":"BlayTheNinth","name":"BlayTheNinth","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1933180?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-02-28T14:04:06.205061Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"balm-3.2.6.jar"},"mods\\infernalmobs-1.18.6.jar":{"sha512":"dfabefc7405290a2909190337963d8ad4ed74eba50dd59945d6ce09c009c50e2e385699e8f49f67ab64117ce0df3d8ca0a1036a302b1033fe3e3f720f801d2a8","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"Infernal Mobs","description":"Diablo Style random Enchantments on Entities!

Additionally, the dragon no longer spawns from the start - instead, it will be summoned once a player gets close to the bell tower in the center.</p>\n<p>To resummon the dragon, the 4 crystals no longer go right next to the portal. Instead, you'll see 4 bedrock blocks on the floor inside the tower, one in each directional wing of the building. The crystals can be placed on these 4 blocks to start summoning the dragon again. That being said, we do actually still support vanilla crystal summoning positions, to avoid confusing players who aren't familiar with the mod.</p>\n<p>The dragon's AI itself is unchanged.</p>\n<p><b>To use BEI on an existing world,</b> we've provided the <i>/end_island reset</i> command. Using this command while in the End will attempt to reset the dragon fight back to its initial state and replace any previous portal/pillars with our redesigned versions. But this command attempts some major things behind the scenes, so <b>please back up your world before trying!</b> Also note that <b>simply deleting your End dimension files is not suffificient, and you will still need to run the command.</b></p>\n<p>If you're having issues with the portal/tower spawning after using the command, such as the portal spawning under the island, you can use the full command `/end_island reset true` to attempt to place the portal on the surface again.
